Data Structures and Algorithms\\nin Python provides an introduction to data structures and algorithms, including their\\ndesign, analysis, and implementation. This book is designed for use in a beginning-level data structures course, or in an intermediate-level introduction to algorithmscourse. We discuss its use for such courses in more detail later in this preface.\\nTo promote the development of robust and reusable software, we have tried to\\ntake a consistent object-oriented viewpoint throughout this text. One of the mainideas of the object-oriented approach is that data should be presented as being en-capsulated with the methods that access and modify them. That is, rather thansimply viewing data as a collection of bytes and addresses, we think of data ob-\\njects as instances of an abstract data type (ADT ), which includes a repertoire of\\nmethods for performing operations on data objects of this type. We then empha-\\nsize that there may be several different implementation strategies for a particularADT, and explore the relative pros and cons of these choices. We provide complete\\nPython implementations for almost all data structures and algorithms discussed,\\nand we introduce important object-oriented design patterns as means to organize\\nthose implementations into reusable components.\\nDesired outcomes for readers of our book include that:\\n•They have knowledge of the most common abstractions for data collections\\n(e.g., stacks, queues, lists, trees, maps).\\n•They understand algorithmic strategies for producing efﬁcient realizations ofcommon data structures.\\n•They can analyze algorithmic performance, both theoretically and experi-mentally, and recognize common trade-offs between competing strategies.\\n•They can wisely use existing data structures and algorithms found in modern\\nprogramming language libraries.\\n•They have experience working with concrete implementations for most foun-\\ndational data structures and algorithms.\\n•They can apply data structures and algorithms to solve complex problems.\\nIn support of the last goal, we present many example applications of data structuresthroughout the book, including the processing of ﬁle systems, matching of tags\\nin structured formats such as HTML, simple cryptography, text frequency analy-\\nsis, automated geometric layout, Huffman coding, DNA sequence alignment, andsearch engine indexing.\\nv'),\n",

However, this book is not simply a translation\\nof those other books to Python. In adapting the material for this book, we have\\nsigniﬁcantly redesigned the organization and content of the book as follows:\\n•The code base has been entirely redesigned to take advantage of the features\\nof Python, such as use of generators for iterating elements of a collection.\\n•Many algorithms that were presented as pseudo-code in the Java and C++\\nversions are directly presented as complete Python code.\\n•In general, ADTs are deﬁned to have consistent interface with Python’s built-\\nin data types and those in Python’s collections module.\\n•Chapter 5 provides an in-depth exploration of the dynamic array-based un-\\nderpinnings of Python’s built-in list,tuple ,a n dstrclasses. New Appendix A\\nserves as an additional reference regarding the functionality of the strclass.\\n•Over 450 illustrations have been created or revised.\\n•New and revised exercises bring the overall total number to 750.\\nOnline Resources\\nThis book is accompanied by an extensive set of online resources, which can be\\nfound at the following Web site:\\nwww.wiley.com/college/goodrich\\nStudents are encouraged to use this site along with the book, to help with exer-\\ncises and increase understanding of the subject. Instructors are likewise welcome\\nto use the site to help plan, organize, and present their course materials. Included\\non this Web site is a collection of educational aids that augment the topics of this\\nbook, for both students and instructors. Because of their added value, some of theseonline resources are password protected.\\nFor all readers, and especially for students, we include the following resources:\\n•All the Python source code presented in this book.\\n•PDF handouts of Powerpoint slides (four-per-page) provided to instructors.\\n•A database of hints to allexercises, indexed by problem number.\\nFor instructors using this book, we include the following additional teaching aids:\\n•Solutions to hundreds of the book’s exercises.\\n•Color versions of all ﬁgures and illustrations from the book.\\n•Slides in Powerpoint and PDF (one-per-page) format.\\nThe slides are fully editable, so as to allow an instructor using this book full free-dom in customizing his or her presentations. All the online resources are providedat no extra charge to any instructor adopting this book for his or her course.'),\n",

We then add\\nfoundational techniques like algorithm analysis and recursion. In the main portionof the book, we present fundamental data structures and algorithms, concludingwith a discussion of memory management (that is, the architectural underpinningsof data structures). Speciﬁcally, the chapters for this book are organized as follows:\\n1.Python Primer\\n2.Object-Oriented Programming\\n3.Algorithm Analysis\\n4.Recursion\\n5.Array-Based Sequences\\n6.Stacks, Queues, and Deques\\n7.Linked Lists\\n8.Trees\\n9.Priority Queues\\n10.Maps, Hash Tables, and Skip Lists\\n11.Search Trees\\n12.Sorting and Selection\\n13.Text Processing\\n14.Graph Algorithms\\n15.Memory Management and B-Trees\\nA.Character Strings in Python\\nB.Useful Mathematical Facts\\nA more detailed table of contents follows this preface, beginning on page xi.\\nPrerequisites\\nWe assume that the reader is at least vaguely familiar with a high-level program-ming language, such as C, C++, Python, or Java, and that he or she understands themain constructs from such a high-level language, including:\\n•Variables and expressions.\\n•Decision structures (such as if-statements and switch-statements).\\n•Iteration structures (for loops and while loops).\\n•Functions (whether stand-alone or object-oriented methods).\\nFor readers who are familiar with these concepts, but not with how they are ex-pressed in Python, we provide a primer on the Python language in Chapter 1. Still,this book is primarily a data structures book, not a Python book; hence, it does not\\ngive a comprehensive treatment of Python.'),\n",

Python Primer\\n1.1 Python Overview\\nBuilding data structures and algorithms requires that we communicate detailed in-\\nstructions to a computer. An excellent way to perform such communications isusing a high-level computer language, such as Python. The Python programming\\nlanguage was originally developed by Guido van Rossum in the early 1990s, and\\nhas since become a prominently used language in industry and education. The sec-ond major version of the language, Python 2, was released in 2000, and the thirdmajor version, Python 3, released in 2008. We note that there are signiﬁcant in-compatibilities between Python 2 and Python 3. This book is based on Python 3\\n(more speciﬁcally, Python 3.1 or later). The latest version of the language is freely\\navailable at www.python.org, along with documentation and tutorials.\\nIn this chapter, we provide an overview of the Python programming language,\\nand we continue this discussion in the next chapter, focusing on object-orientedprinciples. We assume that readers of this book have prior programming experi-\\nence, although not necessarily using Python. This book does not provide a com-\\nplete description of the Python language (there are numerous language referencesfor that purpose), but it does introduce all aspects of the language that are used incode fragments later in this book.\\n1.1.1 The Python Interpreter\\nPython is formally an interpreted language. Commands are executed through a\\npiece of software known as the Python interpreter . The interpreter receives a com-\\nmand, evaluates that command, and reports the result of the command. While theinterpreter can be used interactively (especially when debugging), a programmertypically deﬁnes a series of commands in advance and saves those commands in aplain text ﬁle known as source code or ascript . For Python, source code is conven-\\ntionally stored in a ﬁle named with the .pysufﬁx (e.g., demo.py).\\nOn most operating systems, the Python interpreter can be started by typing\\npython from the command line. By default, the interpreter starts in interactive\\nmode with a clean workspace. Commands from a predeﬁned script saved in aﬁle (e.g., demo.py) are executed by invoking the interpreter with the ﬁlename as\\nan argument (e.g., python demo.py), or using an additional -iﬂ a gi no r d e rt o\\nexecute a script and then enter interactive mode (e.g., python -i demo.py).\\nMany integrated development environments (IDEs) provide richer software\\ndevelopment platforms for Python, including one named IDLE that is includedwith the standard Python distribution. IDLE provides an embedded text-editor withsupport for displaying and editing Python code, and a basic debugger, allowing\\nstep-by-step execution of a program while examining key variable values.'),\n",

Many of the techniques demonstrated in this example will bediscussed in the remainder of this chapter. At this point, we draw attention to a fewhigh-level issues, for readers who are new to Python as a programming language.\\nPython’s syntax relies heavily on the use of whitespace. Individual statements\\nare typically concluded with a newline character, although a command can extendto another line, either with a concluding backslash character ( \\\\), or if an opening\\ndelimiter has not yet been closed, such as the {character in deﬁning value\\nmap.\\nWhitespace is also key in delimiting the bodies of control structures in Python.\\nSpeciﬁcally, a block of code is indented to designate it as the body of a controlstructure, and nested control structures use increasing amounts of indentation. InCode Fragment 1.1, the body of the while loop consists of the subsequent 8 lines,\\nincluding a nested conditional structure.\\nComments are annotations provided for human readers, yet ignored by the\\nPython interpreter. The primary syntax for comments in Python is based on useof the #character, which designates the remainder of the line as a comment.\\nprint(\\nWelcome to the GPA calculator.\\n )\\nprint(\\n Please enter all your letter grades, one per line.\\n )\\nprint(\\n Enter a blank line to designate the end.\\n )\\n# map from letter grade to point value\\npoints = {\\nA+\\n:4.0,\\n A\\n:4.0,\\n A-\\n:3.67,\\n B+\\n:3.33,\\n B\\n:3.0,\\n B-\\n:2.67,\\nC+\\n:2.33,\\n C\\n:2.0,\\n C\\n:1.67,\\n D+\\n:1.33,\\n D\\n:1.0,\\n F\\n:0.0}\\nnum\\ncourses = 0\\ntotal\\npoints = 0\\ndone = False\\nwhile not done:\\ngrade = input( ) # read line from user\\nifgrade ==\\n : # empty line was entered\\ndone = True\\nelifgradenot in points: # unrecognized grade entered\\nprint( \"Unknown grade\\n {0}\\n being ignored\" .format(grade))\\nelse:\\nnum\\ncourses += 1\\ntotal\\npoints += points[grade]\\nifnum\\ncourses >0: # avoid division by zero\\nprint(\\n Your GPA is {0:.3}\\n .format(total\\n points / num\\n courses))\\nCode Fragment 1.1: A Python program that computes a grade-point average (GPA).'),\n",

Python Primer\\n1.2 Objects in Python\\nPython is an object-oriented language and classes form the basis for all data types.\\nIn this section, we describe key aspects of Python’s object model, and we intro-\\nduce Python’s built-in classes, such as the intclass for integers, the ﬂoat class\\nfor ﬂoating-point values, and the strclass for character strings. A more thorough\\npresentation of object-orientation is the focus of Chapter 2.\\n1.2.1 Identiﬁers, Objects, and the Assignment Statement\\nThe most important of all Python commands is an assignment statement ,s u c ha s\\ntemperature = 98.6\\nThis command establishes temperature as an identiﬁer (also known as a name ),\\nand then associates it with the object expressed on the right-hand side of the equal\\nsign, in this case a ﬂoating-point object with value 98.6. We portray the outcome\\nof this assignment in Figure 1.1.\\nﬂoat\\n98.6temperature\\nFigure 1.1: The identiﬁer temperature references an instance of the ﬂoat class\\nhaving value 98.6.\\nIdentiﬁers\\nIdentiﬁers in Python are case-sensitive ,s otemperature andTemperature are dis-\\ntinct names. Identiﬁers can be composed of almost any combination of letters,\\nnumerals, and underscore characters (or more general Unicode characters). Theprimary restrictions are that an identiﬁer cannot begin with a numeral (thus 9lives\\nis an illegal name), and that there are 33 specially reserved words that cannot beused as identiﬁers, as shown in Table 1.1.\\nReserved Words\\nFalse as continue else from in not return yield\\nNone assert def except global is or try\\nTrue break del ﬁnally if lambda pass while\\nand class elif for import nonlocal raise with\\nTable 1.1: A listing of the reserved words in Python. These names cannot be used\\nas identiﬁers.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Michel T.Goodrich ,Roberto Tamassia, Michel H.Gold wasser, Data Structures and Algorithms in Python.pdf', 'page': 26}, page_content='1.2. Objects in Python 5\\nFor readers familiar with other programming languages, the semantics of a\\nPython identiﬁer is most similar to a reference variable in Java or a pointer variable\\nin C++. Each identiﬁer is implicitly associated with the memory address of the\\nobject to which it refers. A Python identiﬁer may be assigned to a special objectnamed None , serving a similar purpose to a null reference in Java or C++.\\nUnlike Java and C++, Python is a dynamically typed language, as there is no\\nadvance declaration associating an identiﬁer with a particular data type. An iden-\\ntiﬁer can be associated with any type of object, and it can later be reassigned to\\nanother object of the same (or different) type. Although an identiﬁer has no de-clared type, the object to which it refers has a deﬁnite type. In our ﬁrst example,the characters 98.6 are recognized as a ﬂoating-point literal, and thus the identiﬁer\\ntemperature is associated with an instance of the ﬂoat class having that value.\\nA programmer can establish an alias by assigning a second identiﬁer to an\\nexisting object. Continuing with our earlier example, Figure 1.2 portrays the resultof a subsequent assignment, original = temperature .\\nﬂoat\\n98.6original temperature\\nFigure 1.2: Identiﬁers temperature andoriginal are aliases for the same object.\\nOnce an alias has been established, either name can be used to access the under-\\nlying object. If that object supports behaviors that affect its state, changes enactedthrough one alias will be apparent when using the other alias (because they refer tothe same object). However, if one of the names is reassigned to a new value using\\na subsequent assignment statement, that does not affect the aliased object, rather itbreaks the alias. Continuing with our concrete example, we consider the command:\\ntemperature = temperature + 5.0\\nThe execution of this command begins with the evaluation of the expression on theright-hand side of the =operator. That expression, temperature + 5.0 ,i se v a l -\\nuated based on the existing binding of the name temperature , and so the result\\nhas value 103.6, that is, 98.6 + 5.0. That result is stored as a new ﬂoating-point\\ninstance, and only then is the name on the left-hand side of the assignment state-\\nment,temperature , (re)assigned to the result. The subsequent conﬁguration is dia-\\ngrammed in Figure 1.3. Of particular note, this last command had no effect on thevalue of the existing ﬂoat instance that identiﬁer original continues to reference.\\n98.6ﬂoat\\n103.6temperature originalﬂoat\\nFigure 1.3: Thetemperature identiﬁer has been assigned to a new value, while\\noriginal continues to refer to the previously existing value.'),\n",

Python Primer\\n1.2.2 Creating and Using Objects\\nInstantiation\\nThe process of creating a new instance of a class is known as instantiation .I n\\ngeneral, the syntax for instantiating an object is to invoke the constructor of a class.\\nFor example, if there were a class named Widget , we could create an instance of\\nthat class using a syntax such as w=W i d g e t ( ) , assuming that the constructor does\\nnot require any parameters. If the constructor does require parameters, we might\\nuse a syntax such as Widget(a, b, c) to construct a new instance.\\nMany of Python’s built-in classes (discussed in Section 1.2.3) support what is\\nknown as a literal form for designating new instances. For example, the command\\ntemperature = 98.6 results in the creation of a new instance of the ﬂoat class; the\\nterm98.6 in that expression is a literal form. We discuss further cases of Python\\nliterals in the coming section.\\nFrom a programmer’s perspective, yet another way to indirectly create a new\\ninstance of a class is to call a function that creates and returns such an instance. For\\nexample, Python has a built-in function named sorted (see Section 1.5.2) that takes\\na sequence of comparable elements as a parameter and returns a new instance ofthelistclass containing those elements in sorted order.\\nCalling Methods\\nPython supports traditional functions (see Section 1.5) that are invoked with a syn-tax such as sorted(data) , in which case data is a parameter sent to the function.\\nPython’s classes may also deﬁne one or more methods (also known as member\\nfunctions ), which are invoked on a speciﬁc instance of a class using the dot (“.”)\\noperator. For example, Python’s listclass has a method named sort that can be\\ninvoked with a syntax such as data.sort(). This particular method rearranges the\\ncontents of the list so that they are sorted.\\nThe expression to the left of the dot identiﬁes the object upon which the method\\nis invoked. Often, this will be an identiﬁer (e.g., data), but we can use the dot op-\\nerator to invoke a method upon the immediate result of some other operation. For\\nexample, if response identiﬁes a string instance (we will discuss strings later in this\\nsection), the syntax response.lower().startswith(\\ny\\n)ﬁrst evaluates the method\\ncall,response.lower(), which itself returns a new string instance, and then the\\nstartswith(\\n y\\n)method is called on that intermediate string.\\nWhen using a method of a class, it is important to understand its behavior.\\nSome methods return information about the state of an object, but do not change\\nthat state.

A classisimmutable if each object of that class has a ﬁxed value upon instantiation that\\ncannot subsequently be changed. For example, the ﬂoat class is immutable.

Literalforms (such as 98.6) exist for most of the built-in classes, and all of the classes\\nsupport a traditional constructor form that creates instances that are based upon\\none or more existing values. Operators supported by these classes are described inSection 1.3. More detailed information about these classes can be found in laterchapters as follows: lists and tuples (Chapter 5); strings (Chapters 5 and 13, and\\nAppendix A); sets and dictionaries (Chapter 10).\\nThe bool Class\\nThebool class is used to manipulate logical (Boolean) values, and the only two\\ninstances of that class are expressed as the literals True andFalse . The default\\nconstructor, bool() , returns False , but there is no reason to use that syntax rather\\nthan the more direct literal form. Python allows the creation of a Boolean value\\nfrom a nonboolean type using the syntax bool(foo) for value foo. The interpretation\\ndepends upon the type of the parameter. Numbers evaluate to False if zero, and\\nTrue if nonzero. Sequences and other container types, such as strings and lists,\\nevaluate to False if empty and True if nonempty. An important application of this\\ninterpretation is the use of a nonboolean value as a condition in a control structure.'),\n",

Python Primer\\nThe int Class\\nTheintandﬂoat classes are the primary numeric types in Python. The intclass is\\ndesigned to represent integer values with arbitrary magnitude. Unlike Java and\\nC++, which support different integral types with different precisions (e.g., int,\\nshort ,long), Python automatically chooses the internal representation for an in-\\nteger based upon the magnitude of its value. Typical literals for integers include 0,\\n137,a n d−23. In some contexts, it is convenient to express an integral value using\\nbinary, octal, or hexadecimal. That can be done by using a preﬁx of the number 0\\nand then a character to describe the base. Example of such literals are respectively\\n0b1011 ,0o52 ,a n d0x7f.\\nThe integer constructor, int() , returns value 0 by default. But this constructor\\ncan be used to construct an integer value based upon an existing value of anothertype. For example, if frepresents a ﬂoating-point value, the syntax int(f) produces\\nthetruncated value of f. For example, both int(3.14) andint(3.99) produce the\\nvalue3, while int(−3.9) produces the value −3. The constructor can also be used\\nto parse a string that is presumed to represent an integral value (such as one en-tered by a user). If srepresents a string, then int(s) produces the integral value\\nthat string represents. For example, the expression int(\\n137\\n)produces the inte-\\nger value 137. If an invalid string is given as a parameter, as in int(\\n hello\\n ),a\\nValueError is raised (see Section 1.7 for discussion of Python’s exceptions). By de-\\nfault, the string must use base 10. If conversion from a different base is desired, thatbase can be indicated as a second, optional, parameter. For example, the expression\\nint(\\n7f\\n, 16) evaluates to the integer 127.\\nThe ﬂoat Class\\nTheﬂoat class is the sole ﬂoating-point type in Python, using a ﬁxed-precision\\nrepresentation. Its precision is more akin to a double in Java or C++, rather than\\nthose languages’ ﬂoat type. We have already discussed a typical literal form, 98.6.\\nWe note that the ﬂoating-point equivalent of an integral number can be expressed\\ndirectly as 2.0. Technically, the trailing zero is optional, so some programmers\\nmight use the expression 2.to designate this ﬂoating-point literal. One other form\\nof literal for ﬂoating-point values uses scientiﬁc notation. For example, the literal6.022e23 represents the mathematical value 6 .022×10\\n23.\\nThe constructor form of ﬂoat() returns 0.0. When given a parameter, the con-\\nstructor attempts to return the equivalent ﬂoating-point value. For example, the callﬂoat(2) returns the ﬂoating-point value 2.0. If the parameter to the constructor is\\na string, as with ﬂoat(\\n3.14\\n ), it attempts to parse that string as a ﬂoating-point\\nvalue, raising a ValueError as an exception.'),\n",

Objects in Python 9\\nSequence Types: The list, tuple, and str Classes\\nThelist,tuple ,a n dstrclasses are sequence types in Python, representing a col-\\nlection of values in which the order is signiﬁcant. The listclass is the most general,\\nrepresenting a sequence of arbitrary objects (akin to an “array” in other languages).\\nThetuple class is an immutable version of the listclass, beneﬁting from a stream-\\nlined internal representation. The strclass is specially designed for representing\\nan immutable sequence of text characters. We note that Python does not have aseparate class for characters; they are just strings with length one.\\nThe list Class\\nAlistinstance stores a sequence of objects. A list is a referential structure, as it\\ntechnically stores a sequence of references to its elements (see Figure 1.4). El-\\nements of a list may be arbitrary objects (including the None object). Lists are\\narray-based sequences and are zero-indexed , thus a list of length nhas elements\\nindexed from 0 to n−1 inclusive. Lists are perhaps the most used container type in\\nPython and they will be extremely central to our study of data structures and algo-rithms. They have many valuable behaviors, including the ability to dynamically\\nexpand and contract their capacities as needed. In this chapter, we will discuss only\\nthe most basic properties of lists. We revisit the inner working of all of Python’ssequence types as the focus of Chapter 5.\\nPython uses the characters []as delimiters for a listliteral, with []itself being\\nan empty list. As another example, [\\nred\\n,\\ngreen\\n ,\\nblue\\n ]is a list containing\\nthree string instances. The contents of a list literal need not be expressed as literals;if identiﬁers aandbhave been established, then syntax [a, b] is legitimate.\\nThelist() constructor produces an empty list by default. However, the construc-\\ntor will accept any parameter that is of an iterable type. We will discuss iteration\\nfurther in Section 1.8, but examples of iterable types include all of the standard con-tainer types (e.g., strings, list, tuples, sets, dictionaries). For example, the syntaxlist(\\nhello\\n )produces a list of individual characters, [\\nh\\n,\\ne\\n,\\nl\\n,\\nl\\n,\\no\\n].\\nBecause an existing list is itself iterable, the syntax backup = list(data) can be\\nused to construct a new list instance referencing the same contents as the original.\\n3 4 5 6 7 012 1 0 9 8primes :13 19 23 29 31 7 5 3 21 1 17\\nFigure 1.4: Python’s internal representation of a list of integers, instantiated as\\nprime = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31] .

Python Primer\\nT h et u p l eC l a s s\\nThetuple class provides an immutable version of a sequence, and therefore its\\ninstances have an internal representation that may be more streamlined than that of\\na list. While Python uses the []characters to delimit a list, parentheses delimit a\\ntuple, with ()being an empty tuple. There is one important subtlety. To express\\na tuple of length one as a literal, a comma must be placed after the element, but\\nwithin the parentheses. For example, (17,) is a one-element tuple. The reason for\\nthis requirement is that, without the trailing comma, the expression (17) is viewed\\nas a simple parenthesized numeric expression.\\nThe str Class\\nPython’s strclass is speciﬁcally designed to efﬁciently represent an immutable\\nsequence of characters, based upon the Unicode international character set. Strings\\nhave a more compact internal representation than the referential lists and tuples, as\\nportrayed in Figure 1.5.\\n0ASM P L E\\n345 12\\nFigure 1.5: A Python string, which is an indexed sequence of characters.\\nString literals can be enclosed in single quotes, as in\\n hello\\n , or double\\nquotes, as in \"hello\" . This choice is convenient, especially when using an-\\nother of the quotation characters as an actual character in the sequence, as in\"Don\\nt worry\" . Alternatively, the quote delimiter can be designated using a\\nbackslash as a so-called escape character ,a si n\\n Don\\\\\\n t worry\\n . Because the\\nbackslash has this purpose, the backslash must itself be escaped to occur as a natu-\\nral character of the string literal, as in\\n C:\\\\\\\\Python\\\\\\\\\\n , for a string that would be\\ndisplayed as C:\\\\Python\\\\ . Other commonly escaped characters are \\\\nfor newline\\nand\\\\tfor tab. Unicode characters can be included, such as\\n 20\\\\u20AC\\n for the\\nstring 20\\n.\\nPython also supports using the delimiter\\n or\"\"\"to begin and end a string\\nliteral. The advantage of such triple-quoted strings is that newline characters can\\nbe embedded naturally (rather than escaped as \\\\n). This can greatly improve the\\nreadability of long, multiline strings in source code. For example, at the beginningof Code Fragment 1.1, rather than use separate print statements for each line of\\nintroductory output, we can use a single print statement, as follows:\\nprint(”””Welcome to the GPA calculator.\\nPlease enter all your letter grades, one per line.Enter a blank line to designate the end.”””)'),\n",

Objects in Python 11\\nThe set and frozenset Classes\\nPython’s setclass represents the mathematical notion of a set, namely a collection\\nof elements, without duplicates, and without an inherent order to those elements.\\nThe major advantage of using a set, as opposed to a list,i st h a ti th a sah i g h l y\\noptimized method for checking whether a speciﬁc element is contained in the set.This is based on a data structure known as a hash table (which will be the primary\\ntopic of Chapter 10). However, there are two important restrictions due to the\\nalgorithmic underpinnings. The ﬁrst is that the set does not maintain the elements\\nin any particular order. The second is that only instances of immutable types can be\\nadded to a Python set. Therefore, objects such as integers, ﬂoating-point numbers,\\nand character strings are eligible to be elements of a set. It is possible to maintain a\\nset of tuples, but not a set of lists or a set of sets, as lists and sets are mutable. The\\nfrozenset class is an immutable form of the settype, so it is legal to have a set of\\nfrozensets.\\nPython uses curly braces {and}as delimiters for a set, for example, as {17}\\nor{\\nred\\n,\\ngreen\\n ,\\nblue\\n }. The exception to this rule is that {}does not\\nrepresent an empty set; for historical reasons, it represents an empty dictionary(see next paragraph). Instead, the constructor syntax set() produces an empty set.\\nIf an iterable parameter is sent to the constructor, then the set of distinct elements\\nis produced. For example, set(\\nhello\\n )produces {\\nh\\n,\\ne\\n,\\nl\\n,\\no\\n}.\\nThe dict Class\\nPython’s dict class represents a dictionary ,o rmapping , from a set of distinct keys\\nto associated values . For example, a dictionary might map from unique student ID\\nnumbers, to larger student records (such as the student’s name, address, and course\\ngrades). Python implements a dictusing an almost identical approach to that of a\\nset, but with storage of the associated values.\\nA dictionary literal also uses curly braces, and because dictionaries were intro-\\nduced in Python prior to sets, the literal form {}produces an empty dictionary.\\nA nonempty dictionary is expressed using a comma-separated series of key:valuepairs. For example, the dictionary {\\nga\\n:\\nIrish\\n ,\\nde\\n:\\nGerman\\n }maps\\nga\\nto\\nIrish\\n and\\n de\\nto\\nGerman\\n .\\nThe constructor for the dictclass accepts an existing mapping as a parameter,\\nin which case it creates a new dictionary with identical associations as the existingone. Alternatively, the constructor accepts a sequence of key-value pairs as a pa-\\nrameter, as in dict(pairs) withpairs = [(\\nga\\n,\\nIrish\\n ), (\\nde\\n,\\nGerman\\n )].'),\n",

Python Primer\\n1.3 Expressions, Operators, and Precedence\\nIn the previous section, we demonstrated how names can be used to identify ex-\\nisting objects, and how literals and constructors can be used to create instances of\\nbuilt-in classes. Existing values can be combined into larger syntactic expressions\\nusing a variety of special symbols and keywords known as operators . The seman-\\ntics of an operator depends upon the type of its operands. For example, when a\\nandbare numbers, the syntax a+b indicates addition, while if aandbare strings,\\nthe operator indicates concatenation. In this section, we describe Python’s opera-tors in various contexts of the built-in types.\\nWe continue, in Section 1.3.1, by discussing compound expressions ,s u c ha s\\na+b\\nc, which rely on the evaluation of two or more operations. The order\\nin which the operations of a compound expression are evaluated can affect theoverall value of the expression. For this reason, Python deﬁnes a speciﬁc order of\\nprecedence for evaluating operators, and it allows a programmer to override this\\norder by using explicit parentheses to group subexpressions.\\nLogical Operators\\nPython supports the following keyword operators for Boolean values:\\nnot unary negation\\nand conditional and\\nor conditional or\\nTheand andoroperators short-circuit , in that they do not evaluate the second\\noperand if the result can be determined based on the value of the ﬁrst operand.\\nThis feature is useful when constructing Boolean expressions in which we ﬁrst test\\nthat a certain condition holds (such as a reference not being None ), and then test a\\ncondition that could have otherwise generated an error condition had the prior testnot succeeded.\\nEquality Operators\\nPython supports the following operators to test two notions of equality:\\nis same identity\\nis not different identity\\n== equivalent\\n!= not equivalent\\nThe expression aisbevaluates to True , precisely when identiﬁers aandbare\\naliases for the same object. The expression a= =b tests a more general notion of\\nequivalence.

For example, two strings are con-\\nsidered equivalent if they match character for character. Two sets are equivalent ifthey have the same contents, irrespective of order. In most programming situations,the equivalence tests ==and!=are the appropriate operators; use of isandis not\\nshould be reserved for situations in which it is necessary to detect true aliasing.\\nComparison Operators\\nData types may deﬁne a natural order via the following operators:\\n< less than\\n<=less than or equal to\\n> greater than\\n>=greater than or equal to\\nThese operators have expected behavior for numeric types, and are deﬁned lexi-cographically, and case-sensitively, for strings.

We ﬁrst consider the case\\nin which both operands have type int, for example, the quantity 27 divided by\\n4. In mathematical notation, 27 ÷4=6\\n3\\n4=6.75. In Python, the /operator\\ndesignates true division, returning the ﬂoating-point result of the computation.\\nThus, 2 7/4 results in the ﬂoat value6.75. Python supports the pair of opera-\\ntors//and%to perform the integral calculations, with expression 27 // 4 evalu-\\nating to intvalue 6 (the mathematical ﬂoor of the quotient), and expression 27 % 4\\nevaluating to intvalue 3, the remainder of the integer division.

If a start index or stop index is omitted in the slicing nota-tion, it is presumed to designate the respective extreme of the original sequence.\\nBecause lists are mutable, the syntax s[j] = val can be used to replace an ele-\\nment at a given index.

By default, this is a shorthand for\\nthe more verbose count = count + 5 . For an immutable type, such as a number or\\na string, one should not presume that this syntax changes the value of the existingobject, but instead that it will reassign the identiﬁer to a newly constructed value.(See discussion of Figure 1.3.) However, it is possible for a type to redeﬁne suchsemantics to mutate the object, as the listclass does for the +=operator.\\nalpha = [1, 2, 3]beta = alpha # an alias for alpha\\nbeta += [4, 5] # extends the original list with two more elements\\nbeta = beta + [6, 7] # reassigns beta to a new list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\\nprint(alpha) #w i l lb e[ 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,5 ]\\nThis example demonstrates the subtle difference between the list semantics for the\\nsyntax beta += foo versus beta = beta + foo .'),\n",

The formal order of precedence\\nfor operators in Python is given in Table 1.3. Operators in a category with higher\\nprecedence will be evaluated before those with lower precedence, unless the expres-sion is otherwise parenthesized.

Python Primer\\n1.4 Control Flow\\nIn this section, we review Python’s most fundamental control structures: condi-\\ntional statements and loops. Common to all control structures is the syntax usedin Python for deﬁning blocks of code. The colon character is used to delimit the\\nbeginning of a block of code that acts as a body for a control structure. If the body\\ncan be stated as a single executable statement, it can technically placed on the sameline, to the right of the colon. However, a body is more typically typeset as anindented block starting on the line following the colon. Python relies on the inden-\\ntation level to designate the extent of that block of code, or any nested blocks of\\ncode within. The same principles will be applied when designating the body of a\\nfunction (see Section 1.5), and the body of a class (see Section 2.3).\\n1.4.1 Conditionals\\nConditional constructs (also known as ifstatements) provide a way to execute a\\nchosen block of code based on the run-time evaluation of one or more Booleanexpressions. In Python, the most general form of a conditional is written as follows:\\nifﬁrst\\ncondition:\\nﬁrst\\n body\\nelif second\\n condition:\\nsecond\\n body\\nelif third\\n condition:\\nthird\\n body\\nelse:\\nfourth\\n body\\nEach condition is a Boolean expression, and each body contains one or more com-mands that are to be executed conditionally. If the ﬁrst condition succeeds, the ﬁrst\\nbody will be executed; no other conditions or bodies are evaluated in that case.\\nIf the ﬁrst condition fails, then the process continues in similar manner with theevaluation of the second condition. The execution of this overall construct willcause precisely one of the bodies to be executed. There may be any number ofelifclauses (including zero), and the ﬁnal else clause is optional. As described on\\npage 7, nonboolean types may be evaluated as Booleans with intuitive meanings.For example, if response is a string that was entered by a user, and we want to\\ncondition a behavior on this being a nonempty string, we may write\\nifresponse:\\nas a shorthand for the equivalent,\\nifresponse !=\\n:'),\n",

Python Primer\\n1.4.2 Loops\\nPython offers two distinct looping constructs. A while loop allows general repeti-\\ntion based upon the repeated testing of a Boolean condition. A forloop provides\\nconvenient iteration of values from a deﬁned series (such as characters of a string,\\nelements of a list, or numbers within a given range). We discuss both forms in thissection.\\nWhile Loops\\nThe syntax for a while loop in Python is as follows:\\nwhile condition:\\nbody\\nAs with an ifstatement, condition can be an arbitrary Boolean expression, and\\nbody can be an arbitrary block of code (including nested control structures). The\\nexecution of a while loop begins with a test of the Boolean condition. If that condi-tion evaluates to True , the body of the loop is performed. After each execution of\\nthe body, the loop condition is retested, and if it evaluates to True , another iteration\\nof the body is performed. When the conditional test evaluates to False (assuming\\nit ever does), the loop is exited and the ﬂow of control continues just beyond thebody of the loop.\\nAs an example, here is a loop that advances an index through a sequence of\\ncharacters until ﬁnding an entry with value\\nX\\nor reaching the end of the sequence.\\nj=0while j<len(data) anddata[j] !=\\nX\\n:\\nj+ =1\\nThelenfunction, which we will introduce in Section 1.5.2, returns the length of a\\nsequence such as a list or string. The correctness of this loop relies on the short-circuiting behavior of the and operator, as described on page 12. We intention-\\nally test j<len(data) to ensure that jis a valid index, prior to accessing element\\ndata[j] . Had we written that compound condition with the opposite order, the eval-\\nuation of data[j] would eventually raise an IndexError when\\nX\\nis not found. (See\\nSection 1.7 for discussion of exceptions.)\\nAs written, when this loop terminates, variable j’s value will be the index of\\nthe leftmost occurrence of\\n X\\n, if found, or otherwise the length of the sequence\\n(which is recognizable as an invalid index to indicate failure of the search). It isworth noting that this code behaves correctly, even in the special case when the listis empty, as the condition j<len(data) will initially fail and the body of the loop\\nwill never be executed.'),\n",

Control Flow 21\\nFor Loops\\nPython’s for-loop syntax is a more convenient alternative to a while loop when\\niterating through a series of elements. The for-loop syntax can be used on any\\ntype of iterable structure, such as a list,tuple str ,set,dict,o rﬁle(we will discuss\\niterators more formally in Section 1.8). Its general syntax appears as follows.\\nfor element initerable :\\nbody #b o d ym a yr e f e rt o\\n element\\n as an identiﬁer\\nFor readers familiar with Java, the semantics of Python’s for loop is similar to the“for each” loop style introduced in Java 1.5.\\nAs an instructive example of such a loop, we consider the task of computing\\nthe sum of a list of numbers. (Admittedly, Python has a built-in function, sum,f o r\\nthis purpose.) We perform the calculation with a for loop as follows, assuming thatdata identiﬁes the list:\\ntotal = 0\\nforvalindata:\\ntotal += val # note use of the loop variable, val\\nThe loop body executes once for each element of the data sequence, with the iden-\\ntiﬁer, val, from the for-loop syntax assigned at the beginning of each pass to a\\nrespective element. It is worth noting that valis treated as a standard identiﬁer. If\\nthe element of the original data happens to be mutable, the validentiﬁer can be\\nused to invoke its methods. But a reassignment of identiﬁer valto a new value has\\nno affect on the original data, nor on the next iteration of the loop.\\nAs a second classic example, we consider the task of ﬁnding the maximum\\nvalue in a list of elements (again, admitting that Python’s built-in max function\\nalready provides this support). If we can assume that the list, data, has at least one\\nelement, we could implement this task as follows:\\nbiggest = data[0] # as we assume nonempty list\\nforvalindata:\\nifval>biggest:\\nbiggest = val\\nAlthough we could accomplish both of the above tasks with a while loop, the\\nfor-loop syntax had an advantage of simplicity, as there is no need to manage anexplicit index into the list nor to author a Boolean loop condition. Furthermore, wecan use a for loop in cases for which a while loop does not apply, such as wheniterating through a collection, such as a set, that does not support any direct form\\nof indexing.'),\n",

Python Primer\\nIndex-Based For Loops\\nThe simplicity of a standard for loop over the elements of a list is wonderful; how-\\never, one limitation of that form is that we do not know where an element resides\\nwithin the sequence. In some applications, we need knowledge of the index of anelement within the sequence. For example, suppose that we want to know where\\nthe maximum element in a list resides.\\nRather than directly looping over the elements of the list in that case, we prefer\\nto loop over all possible indices of the list. For this purpose, Python providesa built-in class named range that generates integer sequences. (We will discuss\\ngenerators in Section 1.8.) In simplest form, the syntax range(n) generates the\\nseries of nvalues from 0 to n−1. Conveniently, these are precisely the series of\\nvalid indices into a sequence of length n. Therefore, a standard Python idiom for\\nlooping through the series of indices of a data sequence uses a syntax,\\nforjinrange(len(data)):\\nIn this case, identiﬁer jis not an element of the data—it is an integer. But the\\nexpression data[j] can be used to retrieve the respective element. For example, we\\ncan ﬁnd the index of the maximum element of a list as follows:\\nbig\\nindex = 0\\nforjinrange(len(data)):\\nifdata[j] >data[big\\n index]:\\nbig\\nindex = j\\nBreak and Continue Statements\\nPython supports a break statement that immediately terminate a while or for loop\\nwhen executed within its body. More formally, if applied within nested controlstructures, it causes the termination of the most immediately enclosing loop. Asa typical example, here is code that determines whether a target value occurs in adata set:\\nfound = False\\nforitemindata:\\nifitem == target:\\nfound = True\\nbreak\\nPython also supports a continue statement that causes the current iteration of a\\nloop body to stop, but with subsequent passes of the loop proceeding as expected.\\nWe recommend that the break andcontinue statements be used sparingly. Yet,\\nthere are situations in which these commands can be effectively used to avoid in-\\ntroducing overly complex logical conditions.'),\n",

Functions 23\\n1.5 Functions\\nIn this section, we explore the creation of and use of functions in Python. As we\\ndid in Section 1.2.2, we draw a distinction between functions andmethods .W e\\nuse the general term function to describe a traditional, stateless function that is in-\\nvoked without the context of a particular class or an instance of that class, such as\\nsorted(data) . We use the more speciﬁc term method to describe a member function\\nthat is invoked upon a speciﬁc object using an object-oriented message passing syn-\\ntax, such as data.sort() . In this section, we only consider pure functions; methods\\nwill be explored with more general object-oriented principles in Chapter 2.\\nWe begin with an example to demonstrate the syntax for deﬁning functions in\\nPython. The following function counts the number of occurrences of a given targetvalue within any form of iterable data set.\\ndefcount(data, target):\\nn=0\\nforitemindata:\\nifitem == target: # found a match\\nn+ =1\\nreturn n\\nThe ﬁrst line, beginning with the keyword def, serves as the function’s signature .\\nThis establishes a new identiﬁer as the name of the function ( count , in this exam-\\nple), and it establishes the number of parameters that it expects, as well as namesidentifying those parameters ( data andtarget , in this example). Unlike Java and\\nC++, Python is a dynamically typed language, and therefore a Python signaturedoes not designate the types of those parameters, nor the type (if any) of a return\\nvalue. Those expectations should be stated in the function’s documentation (see\\nSection 2.2.3) and can be enforced within the body of the function, but misuse of afunction will only be detected at run-time.\\nThe remainder of the function deﬁnition is known as the body of the func-\\ntion. As is the case with control structures in Python, the body of a function is\\ntypically expressed as an indented block of code. Each time a function is called,\\nPython creates a dedicated activation record that stores information relevant to the\\ncurrent call. This activation record includes what is known as a namespace (see\\nSection 1.10) to manage all identiﬁers that have local scope within the current call.\\nThe namespace includes the function’s parameters and any other identiﬁers that aredeﬁned locally within the body of the function. An identiﬁer in the local scopeof the function caller has no relation to any identiﬁer with the same name in thecaller’s scope (although identiﬁers in different scopes may be aliases to the sameobject). In our ﬁrst example, the identiﬁer nhas scope that is local to the function\\ncall, as does the identiﬁer item, which is established as the loop variable.'),\n",

Python Primer\\nReturn Statement\\nAreturn statement is used within the body of a function to indicate that the func-\\ntion should immediately cease execution, and that an expressed value should be\\nreturned to the caller. If a return statement is executed without an explicit argu-\\nment, the None value is automatically returned. Likewise, None will be returned if\\nthe ﬂow of control ever reaches the end of a function body without having executeda return statement. Often, a return statement will be the ﬁnal command within the\\nbody of the function, as was the case in our earlier example of a count function.\\nHowever, there can be multiple return statements in the same function, with con-\\nditional logic controlling which such command is executed, if any. As a furtherexample, consider the following function that tests if a value exists in a sequence.\\ndefcontains(data, target):\\nforitemintarget:\\nifitem == target: # found a match\\nreturn True\\nreturn False\\nIf the conditional within the loop body is ever satisﬁed, the return True statement is\\nexecuted and the function immediately ends, with True designating that the target\\nvalue was found. Conversely, if the for loop reaches its conclusion without ever\\nﬁnding the match, the ﬁnal return False statement will be executed.\\n1.5.1 Information Passing\\nTo be a successful programmer, one must have clear understanding of the mech-\\nanism in which a programming language passes information to and from a func-\\ntion. In the context of a function signature, the identiﬁers used to describe the\\nexpected parameters are known as formal parameters , and the objects sent by the\\ncaller when invoking the function are the actual parameters . Parameter passing\\nin Python follows the semantics of the standard assignment statement .W h e n a\\nfunction is invoked, each identiﬁer that serves as a formal parameter is assigned, inthe function’s local scope, to the respective actual parameter that is provided by thecaller of the function.\\nFor example, consider the following call to our count function from page 23:\\nprizes = count(grades,\\nA\\n)\\nJust before the function body is executed, the actual parameters, grades and\\n A\\n,\\nare implicitly assigned to the formal parameters, data andtarget , as follows:\\ndata = gradestarget =\\nA\\n'),\n",

Functions 25\\nThese assignment statements establish identiﬁer data as an alias for grades and\\ntarget as a name for the string literal\\n A\\n.( S e eF i g u r e1 . 7 . )\\n...str\\nA\\ndata target grades\\nlist\\nFigure 1.7: A portrayal of parameter passing in Python, for the function call\\ncount(grades,\\n A\\n). Identiﬁers data andtarget are formal parameters deﬁned\\nwithin the local scope of the count function.\\nThe communication of a return value from the function back to the caller is\\nsimilarly implemented as an assignment. Therefore, with our sample invocation of\\nprizes = count(grades,\\n A\\n), the identiﬁer prizes in the caller’s scope is assigned\\nto the object that is identiﬁed as nin the return statement within our function body.\\nAn advantage to Python’s mechanism for passing information to and from a\\nfunction is that objects are not copied. This ensures that the invocation of a function\\nis efﬁcient, even in a case where a parameter or return value is a complex object.\\nMutable Parameters\\nPython’s parameter passing model has additional implications when a parameter is\\na mutable object. Because the formal parameter is an alias for the actual parameter,\\nthe body of the function may interact with the object in ways that change its state.Considering again our sample invocation of the count function, if the body of the\\nfunction executes the command data.append(\\nF\\n), the new entry is added to the\\nend of the list identiﬁed as data within the function, which is one and the same as\\nthe list known to the caller as grades . As an aside, we note that reassigning a new\\nvalue to a formal parameter with a function body, such as by setting data = [ ] ,\\ndoes not alter the actual parameter; such a reassignment simply breaks the alias.\\nOur hypothetical example of a count method that appends a new element to a\\nlist lacks common sense. There is no reason to expect such a behavior, and it would\\nbe quite a poor design to have such an unexpected effect on the parameter. There\\nare, however, many legitimate cases in which a function may be designed (andclearly documented) to modify the state of a parameter. As a concrete example,we present the following implementation of a method named scale that’s primary\\npurpose is to multiply all entries of a numeric data set by a given factor.\\ndefscale(data, factor):\\nforjinrange(len(data)):\\ndata[j]\\n=f a c t o r'),\n",

Python Primer\\nDefault Parameter Values\\nPython provides means for functions to support more than one possible calling\\nsignature. Such a function is said to be polymorphic (which is Greek for “many\\nforms”). Most notably, functions can declare one or more default values for pa-rameters, thereby allowing the caller to invoke a function with varying numbers ofactual parameters. As an artiﬁcial example, if a function is declared with signature\\ndeffoo(a, b=15, c=27):\\nthere are three parameters, the last two of which offer default values. A caller is\\nwelcome to send three actual parameters, as in foo(4, 12, 8) , in which case the de-\\nfault values are not used. If, on the other hand, the caller only sends one parameter,\\nfoo(4) , the function will execute with parameters values a=4, b=15, c=27 .I f a\\ncaller sends two parameters, they are assumed to be the ﬁrst two, with the third be-ing the default. Thus, foo(8, 20) executes with a=8, b=20, c=27 .H o w e v e r ,i ti s\\nillegal to deﬁne a function with a signature such as bar(a, b=15, c) withbhaving\\na default value, yet not the subsequent c; if a default parameter value is present for\\none parameter, it must be present for all further parameters.\\nAs a more motivating example for the use of a default parameter, we revisit\\nthe task of computing a student’s GPA (see Code Fragment 1.1). Rather than as-sume direct input and output with the console, we prefer to design a function thatcomputes and returns a GPA. Our original implementation uses a ﬁxed mapping\\nfrom each letter grade (such as a B−) to a corresponding point value (such as\\n2.67). While that point system is somewhat common, it may not agree with the\\nsystem used by all schools. (For example, some may assign an\\nA+\\ngrade a value\\nhigher than 4.0.) Therefore, we design a compute\\n gpafunction, given in Code\\nFragment 1.2, which allows the caller to specify a custom mapping from grades to\\nvalues, while offering the standard point system as a default.\\ndefcompute\\n gpa(grades, points= {\\nA+\\n:4.0,\\n A\\n:4.0,\\n A-\\n:3.67,\\n B+\\n:3.33,\\nB\\n:3.0,\\n B-\\n:2.67,\\n C+\\n:2.33,\\n C\\n:2.0,\\nC\\n:1.67,\\n D+\\n:1.33,\\n D\\n:1.0,\\n F\\n:0.0}):\\nnum\\ncourses = 0\\ntotal\\npoints = 0\\nforgingrades:\\nifginpoints: # a recognizable grade\\nnum\\ncourses += 1\\ntotal\\npoints += points[g]\\nreturn total\\npoints / num\\n courses\\nCode Fragment 1.2: A function that computes a student’s GPA with a point value\\nsystem that can be customized as an optional parameter.'),\n",

Functions 27\\nAs an additional example of an interesting polymorphic function, we consider\\nPython’s support for range . (Technically, this is a constructor for the range class,\\nbut for the sake of this discussion, we can treat it as a pure function.) Three calling\\nsyntaxes are supported. The one-parameter form, range(n) , generates a sequence of\\nintegers from 0 up to but not including n. A two-parameter form, range(start,stop)\\ngenerates integers from start up to, but not including, stop. A three-parameter\\nform,range(start, stop, step) , generates a similar range as range(start, stop) ,b u t\\nwith increments of size step rather than 1.\\nThis combination of forms seems to violate the rules for default parameters.\\nIn particular, when a single parameter is sent, as in range(n) , it serves as the stop\\nvalue (which is the second parameter); the value of start is effectively 0 in that\\ncase. However, this effect can be achieved with some sleight of hand, as follows:\\ndefrange(start, stop= None,s t e p = 1 ) :\\nifstopis None :\\nstop = startstart = 0\\n...\\nFrom a technical perspective, when range(n) is invoked, the actual parameter nwill\\nbe assigned to formal parameter start . Within the body, if only one parameter is\\nreceived, the start and stop values are reassigned to provide the desired semantics.\\nKeyword Parameters\\nThe traditional mechanism for matching the actual parameters sent by a caller, tothe formal parameters declared by the function signature is based on the conceptofpositional arguments . For example, with signature foo(a=10, b=20, c=30) ,\\nparameters sent by the caller are matched, in the given order, to the formal param-eters. An invocation of foo(5) indicates that a=5, while bandcare assigned their\\ndefault values.\\nPython supports an alternate mechanism for sending a parameter to a function\\nknown as a keyword argument . A keyword argument is speciﬁed by explicitly\\nassigning an actual parameter to a formal parameter by name. For example, withthe above deﬁnition of function foo, a call foo(c=5) will invoke the function with\\nparameters a=10, b=20, c=5 .\\nA function’s author can require that certain parameters be sent only through the\\nkeyword-argument syntax. We never place such a restriction in our own functiondeﬁnitions, but we will see several important uses of keyword-only parameters inPython’s standard libraries. As an example, the built-in max function accepts a\\nkeyword parameter, coincidentally named key, that can be used to vary the notion\\nof “maximum” that is used.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Michel T.Goodrich ,Roberto Tamassia, Michel H.Gold wasser, Data Structures and Algorithms in Python.pdf', 'page': 49}, page_content='28 Chapter 1. Python Primer\\nBy default, max operates based upon the natural order of elements according\\nto the <operator for that type. But the maximum can be computed by comparing\\nsome other aspect of the elements. This is done by providing an auxiliary function\\nthat converts a natural element to some other value for the sake of comparison.\\nFor example, if we are interested in ﬁnding a numeric value with magnitude that is\\nmaximal (i.e., considering −35to be larger than +20), we can use the calling syn-\\ntaxmax(a, b, key=abs) . In this case, the built-in absfunction is itself sent as the\\nvalue associated with the keyword parameter key. (Functions are ﬁrst-class objects\\nin Python; see Section 1.10.) When max is called in this way, it will compare abs(a)\\ntoabs(b) , rather than atob. The motivation for the keyword syntax as an alternate\\nto positional arguments is important in the case of max. This function is polymor-\\nphic in the number of arguments, allowing a call such as max(a,b,c,d) ; therefore,\\nit is not possible to designate a key function as a traditional positional element.Sorting functions in Python also support a similar keyparameter for indicating a\\nnonstandard order. (We explore this further in Section 9.4 and in Section 12.6.1,\\nwhen discussing sorting algorithms).\\n1.5.2 Python’s Built-In Functions\\nTable 1.4 provides an overview of common functions that are automatically avail-\\nable in Python, including the previously discussed abs,max,a n drange .W h e n\\nchoosing names for the parameters, we use identiﬁers x,y,zfor arbitrary numeric\\ntypes, kfor an integer, and a,b,a n d cfor arbitrary comparable types.

Python Primer\\n1.6 Simple Input and Output\\nIn this section, we address the basics of input and output in Python, describing stan-\\ndard input and output through the user console, and Python’s support for reading\\nand writing text ﬁles.\\n1.6.1 Console Input and Output\\nThe print Function\\nThe built-in function, print , is used to generate standard output to the console.\\nIn its simplest form, it prints an arbitrary sequence of arguments, separated byspaces, and followed by a trailing newline character. For example, the command\\nprint(\\nmaroon\\n ,5 )outputs the string\\n maroon 5\\\\n\\n . Note that arguments need\\nnot be string instances. A nonstring argument xwill be displayed as str(x) . Without\\nany arguments, the command print() outputs a single newline character.\\nTheprint function can be customized through the use of the following keyword\\nparameters (see Section 1.5 for a discussion of keyword parameters):\\n•By default, the print function inserts a separating space into the output be-\\ntween each pair of arguments. The separator can be customized by providinga desired separating string as a keyword parameter, sep. For example, colon-\\nseparated output can be produced as print(a, b, c, sep=\\n:\\n). The separating\\nstring need not be a single character; it can be a longer string, and it can bethe empty string, sep=\\n, causing successive arguments to be directly con-\\ncatenated.\\n•By default, a trailing newline is output after the ﬁnal argument. An alterna-tive trailing string can be designated using a keyword parameter, end. Des-\\nignating the empty string end=\\nsuppresses all trailing characters.\\n•By default, the print function sends its output to the standard console. How-\\never, output can be directed to a ﬁle by indicating an output ﬁle stream (seeSection 1.6.2) using ﬁleas a keyword parameter.\\nThe input Function\\nThe primary means for acquiring information from the user console is a built-infunction named input . This function displays a prompt, if given as an optional pa-\\nrameter, and then waits until the user enters some sequence of characters followedby the return key. The formal return value of the function is the string of charactersthat were entered strictly before the return key (i.e., no newline character exists in\\nthe returned string).'),\n",

Simple Input and Output 31\\nWhen reading a numeric value from the user, a programmer must use the input\\nfunction to get the string of characters, and then use the intorﬂoat syntax to\\nconstruct the numeric value that character string represents. That is, if a call to\\nresponse = input() reports that the user entered the characters,\\n 2013\\n , the syntax\\nint(response) could be used to produce the integer value 2013 . It is quite common\\nto combine these operations with a syntax such as\\nyear = int(input(\\n In what year were you born?\\n ))\\nif we assume that the user will enter an appropriate response. (In Section 1.7 wediscuss error handling in such a situation.)\\nBecause input returns a string as its result, use of that function can be combined\\nwith the existing functionality of the string class, as described in Appendix A. For\\nexample, if the user enters multiple pieces of information on the same line, it is\\ncommon to call the split method on the result, as in\\nreply = input(\\nEnter x and y, separated by spaces:\\n )\\npieces = reply.split( ) # returns a list of strings, as separated by spaces\\nx=ﬂoat(pieces[0])\\ny=ﬂoat(pieces[1])\\nA Sample Program\\nHere is a simple, but complete, program that demonstrates the use of the input\\nandprint functions. The tools for formatting the ﬁnal output is discussed in Ap-\\npendix A.\\nage = int(input(\\n Enter your age in years:\\n ))\\nmax\\nheart\\n rate = 206.9 −(0.67\\n age) # as per Med Sci Sports Exerc.\\ntarget = 0.65\\n max\\nheart\\n rate\\nprint(\\n Your target fat-burning heart rate is\\n ,t a r g e t )\\n1.6.2 Files\\nFiles are typically accessed in Python beginning with a call to a built-in function,named open , that returns a proxy for interactions with the underlying ﬁle.

The default mode is\\n r\\nfor reading. Other common modes are\\n w\\nfor writing to the ﬁle (causing any existing ﬁle with that name to be overwritten),or\\na\\nfor appending to the end of an existing ﬁle.

Exception Handling 33\\n1.7 Exception Handling\\nExceptions are unexpected events that occur during the execution of a program.\\nAn exception might result from a logical error or an unanticipated situation. In\\nPython, exceptions (also known as errors ) are objects that are raised (orthrown )b y\\ncode that encounters an unexpected circumstance. The Python interpreter can alsoraise an exception should it encounter an unexpected condition, like running out ofmemory. A raised error may be caught by a surrounding context that “handles” the\\nexception in an appropriate fashion. If uncaught, an exception causes the interpreterto stop executing the program and to report an appropriate message to the console.In this section, we examine the most common error types in Python, the mechanismfor catching and handling errors that have been raised, and the syntax for raisingerrors from within user-deﬁned blocks of code.\\nCommon Exception Types\\nPython includes a rich hierarchy of exception classes that designate various cate-gories of errors; Table 1.6 shows many of those classes. The Exception class serves\\nas a base class for most other error types. An instance of the various subclassesencodes details about a problem that has occurred. Several of these errors may beraised in exceptional cases by behaviors introduced in this chapter. For example,\\nuse of an undeﬁned identiﬁer in an expression causes a NameError , and errant use\\nof the dot notation, as in foo.bar(), will generate an AttributeError if object foo\\ndoes not support a member named bar.\\nClass\\n Description\\nException\\n A base class for most error types\\nAttributeError\\n Raised by syntax obj.foo ,i fobjhas no member named foo\\nEOFError\\n Raised if “end of ﬁle” reached for console or ﬁle input\\nIOError\\n Raised upon failure of I/O operation (e.g., opening ﬁle)\\nIndexError\\n Raised if index to sequence is out of bounds\\nKeyError\\n Raised if nonexistent key requested for set or dictionary\\nKeyboardInterrupt\\n Raised if user types ctrl-C while program is executing\\nNameError\\n Raised if nonexistent identiﬁer used\\nStopIteration\\n Raised by next(iterator) if no element; see Section 1.8\\nTypeError\\n Raised when wrong type of parameter is sent to a function\\nValueError\\n Raised when parameter has invalid value (e.g., sqrt(−5))\\nZeroDivisionError\\n Raised when any division operator used with 0 as divisor\\nTable 1.6: Common exception classes in Python'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Michel T.Goodrich ,Roberto Tamassia, Michel H.Gold wasser, Data Structures and Algorithms in Python.pdf', 'page': 55}, page_content='34 Chapter 1. Python Primer\\nSending the wrong number, type, or value of parameters to a function is another\\ncommon cause for an exception. For example, a call to abs(\\n hello\\n )will raise a\\nTypeError because the parameter is not numeric, and a call to abs(3, 5) will raise\\naTypeError because one parameter is expected. A ValueError is typically raised\\nwhen the correct number and type of parameters are sent, but a value is illegitimate\\nfor the context of the function. For example, the intconstructor accepts a string,\\nas with int(\\n 137\\n),b u ta ValueError is raised if that string does not represent an\\ninteger, as with int(\\n 3.14\\n )orint(\\n hello\\n ).\\nPython’s sequence types (e.g., list,tuple ,a n dstr) raise an IndexError when\\nsyntax such as data[k] is used with an integer kthat is not a valid index for the given\\nsequence (as described in Section 1.2.3). Sets and dictionaries raise a KeyError\\nwhen an attempt is made to access a nonexistent element.\\n1.7.1 Raising an Exception\\nAn exception is thrown by executing the raise statement, with an appropriate in-\\nstance of an exception class as an argument that designates the problem. For exam-ple, if a function for computing a square root is sent a negative value as a parameter,it can raise an exception with the command:\\nraiseValueError(\\nx cannot be negative\\n )\\nThis syntax raises a newly created instance of the ValueError class, with the error\\nmessage serving as a parameter to the constructor. If this exception is not caughtwithin the body of the function, the execution of the function immediately ceasesand the exception is propagated to the calling context (and possibly beyond).\\nWhen checking the validity of parameters sent to a function, it is customary\\nto ﬁrst verify that a parameter is of an appropriate type, and then to verify that ithas an appropriate value. For example, the sqrt function in Python’s math library\\nperforms error-checking that might be implemented as follows:\\ndefsqrt(x):\\nif not isinstance(x, ( int,ﬂoat)):\\nraiseTypeError(\\nx must be numeric\\n )\\nelifx<0:\\nraiseValueError(\\n x cannot be negative\\n )\\n# do the real work here...\\nChecking the type of an object can be performed at run-time using the built-infunction, isinstance . In simplest form, isinstance(obj, cls) returns True if object,\\nobj, is an instance of class, cls, or any subclass of that type. In the above example, a\\nmore general form is used with a tuple of allowable types indicated with the secondparameter. After conﬁrming that the parameter is numeric, the function enforces\\nan expectation that the number be nonnegative, raising a ValueError otherwise.'),\n",

Exception Handling 35\\nHow much error-checking to perform within a function is a matter of debate.\\nChecking the type and value of each parameter demands additional execution time\\nand, if taken to an extreme, seems counter to the nature of Python. Consider thebuilt-in sum function, which computes a sum of a collection of numbers. An im-\\nplementation with rigorous error-checking might be written as follows:\\ndefsum(values):\\nif not isinstance(values, collections.Iterable):\\nraiseTypeError(\\nparameter must be an iterable type\\n )\\ntotal = 0forvinvalues:\\nif not isinstance(v, ( int,ﬂoat)):\\nraiseTypeError(\\nelements must be numeric\\n )\\ntotal = total+ v\\nreturn total\\nThe abstract base class, collections.Iterable , includes all of Python’s iterable con-\\ntainers types that guarantee support for the for-loop syntax (e.g., list,tuple ,set);\\nwe discuss iterables in Section 1.8, and the use of modules, such as collections,i n\\nSection 1.11. Within the body of the for loop, each element is veriﬁed as numericbefore being added to the total. A far more direct and clear implementation of this\\nfunction can be written as follows:\\ndefsum(values):\\ntotal = 0\\nforvinvalues:\\ntotal = total + v\\nreturn total\\nInterestingly, this simple implementation performs exactly like Python’s built-inversion of the function. Even without the explicit checks, appropriate exceptions\\nare raised naturally by the code. In particular, if values is not an iterable type, the\\nattempt to use the for-loop syntax raises a TypeError reporting that the object is not\\niterable. In the case when a user sends an iterable type that includes a nonnumer-\\nical element, such as sum([3.14,\\noops\\n ]),aTypeError is naturally raised by the\\nevaluation of expression total + v . The error message\\nunsupported operand type(s) for +: ’float’ and ’str’\\nshould be sufﬁciently informative to the caller. Perhaps slightly less obvious is theerror that results from sum([\\nalpha\\n ,\\nbeta\\n ]). It will technically report a failed\\nattempt to add an intandstr, due to the initial evaluation of total +\\n alpha\\n ,\\nwhentotal has been initialized to 0.\\nIn the remainder of this book, we tend to favor the simpler implementations\\nin the interest of clean presentation, performing minimal error-checking in most\\nsituations.'),\n",

Python Primer\\n1.7.2 Catching an Exception\\nThere are several philosophies regarding how to cope with possible exceptional\\ncases when writing code. For example, if a division x/yis to be computed, there\\nis clear risk that a ZeroDivisionError will be raised when variable yhas value 0.I n\\nan ideal situation, the logic of the program may dictate that yhas a nonzero value,\\nthereby removing the concern for error. However, for more complex code, or in\\na case where the value of ydepends on some external input to the program, there\\nremains some possibility of an error.\\nOne philosophy for managing exceptional cases is to “look before you leap.”\\nThe goal is to entirely avoid the possibility of an exception being raised through\\nthe use of a proactive conditional test. Revisiting our division example, we mightavoid the offending situation by writing:\\nify! =0 :\\nratio = x / y\\nelse:\\n... do something else ...\\nA second philosophy, often embraced by Python programmers, is that “it is\\neasier to ask for forgiveness than it is to get permission.” This quote is attributed\\nto Grace Hopper, an early pioneer in computer science. The sentiment is that weneed not spend extra execution time safeguarding against every possible excep-tional case, as long as there is a mechanism for coping with a problem after itarises. In Python, this philosophy is implemented using a try-except control struc-\\nture. Revising our ﬁrst example, the division operation can be guarded as follows:\\ntry:\\nratio = x / y\\nexcept ZeroDivisionError:\\n... do something else ...\\nIn this structure, the “try” block is the primary code to be executed. Although itis a single command in this example, it can more generally be a larger block ofindented code. Following the try-block are one or more “except” cases, each with\\nan identiﬁed error type and an indented block of code that should be executed if the\\ndesignated error is raised within the try-block.\\nThe relative advantage of using a try-except structure is that the non-exceptional\\ncase runs efﬁciently, without extraneous checks for the exceptional condition. How-ever, handling the exceptional case requires slightly more time when using a try-except structure than with a standard conditional statement. For this reason, thetry-except clause is best used when there is reason to believe that the exceptionalcase is relatively unlikely, or when it is prohibitively expensive to proactively eval-\\nuate a condition to avoid the exception.'),\n",

Exception Handling 37\\nException handling is particularly useful when working with user input, or\\nwhen reading from or writing to ﬁles, because such interactions are inherently less\\npredictable. In Section 1.6.2, we suggest the syntax, fp = open(\\n sample.txt\\n ),\\nfor opening a ﬁle with read access. That command may raise an IOError for a vari-\\nety of reasons, such as a non-existent ﬁle, or lack of sufﬁcient privilege for openinga ﬁle. It is signiﬁcantly easier to attempt the command and catch the resulting error\\nthan it is to accurately predict whether the command will succeed.\\nWe continue by demonstrating a few other forms of the try-except syntax. Ex-\\nceptions are objects that can be examined when caught. To do so, an identiﬁer must\\nbe established with a syntax as follows:\\ntry:\\nfp = open(\\nsample.txt\\n )\\nexcept IOError ase:\\nprint(\\n Unable to open the file:\\n ,e )\\nIn this case, the name, e, denotes the instance of the exception that was thrown, and\\nprinting it causes a detailed error message to be displayed (e.g., “ﬁle not found”).\\nA try-statement may handle more than one type of exception. For example,\\nconsider the following command from Section 1.6.1:\\nage = int(input(\\n Enter your age in years:\\n ))\\nThis command could fail for a variety of reasons. The call to input will raise an\\nEOFError if the console input fails. If the call to input completes successfully, the\\nintconstructor raises a ValueError if the user has not entered characters represent-\\ning a valid integer. If we want to handle two or more types of errors in the sameway, we can use a single except-statement, as in the following example:\\nage = −1 # an initially invalid choice\\nwhile age<=0 :\\ntry:\\nage = int(input(\\nEnter your age in years:\\n ))\\nifage<=0 :\\nprint(\\n Your age must be positive\\n )\\nexcept (ValueError, EOFError):\\nprint(\\n Invalid response\\n )\\nWe use the tuple, (ValueError, EOFError) , to designate the types of errors that we\\nwish to catch with the except-clause. In this implementation, we catch either error,print a response, and continue with another pass of the enclosing while loop. Wenote that when an error is raised within the try-block, the remainder of that bodyis immediately skipped. In this example, if the exception arises within the call toinput , or the subsequent call to the intconstructor, the assignment to agenever\\noccurs, nor the message about needing a positive value. Because the value of age'),\n",

Python Primer\\nwill be unchanged, the while loop will continue. If we preferred to have the while\\nloop continue without printing the\\n Invalid response\\n message, we could have\\nwritten the exception-clause as\\nexcept (ValueError, EOFError):\\npass\\nThe keyword, pass , is a statement that does nothing, yet it can serve syntactically\\nas a body of a control structure. In this way, we quietly catch the exception, therebyallowing the surrounding while loop to continue.\\nIn order to provide different responses to different types of errors, we may use\\ntwo or more except-clauses as part of a try-structure. In our previous example, an\\nEOFError suggests a more insurmountable error than simply an errant value being\\nentered. In that case, we might wish to provide a more speciﬁc error message, orperhaps to allow the exception to interrupt the loop and be propagated to a higher\\ncontext. We could implement such behavior as follows:\\nage = −1 # an initially invalid choice\\nwhile age<=0 :\\ntry:\\nage = int(input(\\nEnter your age in years:\\n ))\\nifage<=0 :\\nprint(\\n Your age must be positive\\n )\\nexcept ValueError:\\nprint(\\n That is an invalid age specification\\n )\\nexcept EOFError:\\nprint(\\n There was an unexpected error reading input.\\n )\\nraise #l e t\\ns re-raise this exception\\nIn this implementation, we have separate except-clauses for the ValueError and\\nEOFError cases. The body of the clause for handling an EOFError relies on another\\ntechnique in Python. It uses the raise statement without any subsequent argument,\\nto re-raise the same exception that is currently being handled. This allows us to\\nprovide our own response to the exception, and then to interrupt the while loop andpropagate the exception upward.\\nIn closing, we note two additional features of try-except structures in Python.\\nIt is permissible to have a ﬁnal except-clause without any identiﬁed error types,\\nusing syntax except :, to catch any other exceptions that occurred. However, this\\ntechnique should be used sparingly, as it is difﬁcult to suggest how to handle an\\nerror of an unknown type. A try-statement can have a ﬁnally clause, with a body of\\ncode that will always be executed in the standard or exceptional cases, even whenan uncaught or re-raised exception occurs. That block is typically used for critical\\ncleanup work, such as closing an open ﬁle.'),\n",

Iterators and Generators 39\\n1.8 Iterators and Generators\\nIn Section 1.4.2, we introduced the for-loop syntax beginning as:\\nfor element initerable :\\nand we noted that there are many types of objects in Python that qualify as being\\niterable. Basic container types, such as list,tuple ,a n dset, qualify as iterable types.\\nFurthermore, a string can produce an iteration of its characters, a dictionary can\\nproduce an iteration of its keys, and a ﬁle can produce an iteration of its lines. User-\\ndeﬁned types may also support iteration. In Python, the mechanism for iteration isbased upon the following conventions:\\n•Aniterator is an object that manages an iteration through a series of values. If\\nvariable, i, identiﬁes an iterator object, then each call to the built-in function,\\nnext(i) , produces a subsequent element from the underlying series, with a\\nStopIteration exception raised to indicate that there are no further elements.\\n•Aniterable is an object, obj, that produces an iterator via the syntax iter(obj) .\\nBy these deﬁnitions, an instance of a listis an iterable, but not itself an iterator.\\nWithdata = [1, 2, 4, 8] , it is not legal to call next(data) . However, an iterator\\nobject can be produced with syntax, i = iter(data) , and then each subsequent call\\ntonext(i) will return an element of that list. The for-loop syntax in Python simply\\nautomates this process, creating an iterator for the give iterable, and then repeatedly\\ncalling for the next element until catching the StopIteration exception.\\nMore generally, it is possible to create multiple iterators based upon the same\\niterable object, with each iterator maintaining its own state of progress. However,\\niterators typically maintain their state with indirect reference back to the original\\ncollection of elements. For example, calling iter(data) on a list instance produces\\nan instance of the list\\niterator class. That iterator does not store its own copy of the\\nlist of elements. Instead, it maintains a current index into the original list, represent-\\ning the next element to be reported. Therefore, if the contents of the original list\\nare modiﬁed after the iterator is constructed, but before the iteration is complete,\\nthe iterator will be reporting the updated contents of the list.\\nPython also supports functions and classes that produce an implicit iterable se-\\nries of values, that is, without constructing a data structure to store all of its values\\nat once. For example, the call range(1000000) does notreturn a list of numbers; it\\nreturns a range object that is iterable. This object generates the million values one\\nat a time, and only as needed. Such a lazy evaluation technique has great advan-\\ntage. In the case of range, it allows a loop of the form, forjinrange(1000000): ,\\nto execute without setting aside memory for storing one million values. Also, ifsuch a loop were to be interrupted in some fashion, no time will have been spent\\ncomputing unused values of the range.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Michel T.Goodrich ,Roberto Tamassia, Michel H.Gold wasser, Data Structures and Algorithms in Python.pdf', 'page': 61}, page_content='40 Chapter 1. Python Primer\\nWe see lazy evaluation used in many of Python’s libraries. For example, the\\ndictionary class supports methods keys() ,values() ,a n ditems() , which respec-\\ntively produce a “view” of all keys, values, or (key,value) pairs within a dictionary.\\nNone of these methods produces an explicit list of results. Instead, the views thatare produced are iterable objects based upon the actual contents of the dictionary.An explicit list of values from such an iteration can be immediately constructed by\\ncalling the listclass constructor with the iteration as a parameter. For example, the\\nsyntax list(range(1000)) produces a list instance with values from 0 to 999, while\\nthe syntax list(d.values()) produces a list that has elements based upon the current\\nvalues of dictionary d. We can similarly construct a tuple orsetinstance based\\nupon a given iterable.\\nGenerators\\nIn Section 2.3.4, we will explain how to deﬁne a class whose instances serve as\\niterators. However, the most convenient technique for creating iterators in Python\\nis through the use of generators . A generator is implemented with a syntax that\\nis very similar to a function, but instead of returning values, a yield statement is\\nexecuted to indicate each element of the series. As an example, consider the goal\\nof determining all factors of a positive integer. For example, the number 100 hasfactors 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100. A traditional function might produce and\\nreturn a list containing all factors, implemented as:\\ndeffactors(n): # traditional function that computes factors\\nresults = [ ] # store factors in a new list\\nforkinrange(1,n+1):\\nifn%k= =0 : # divides evenly, thus k is a factor\\nresults.append(k) # add k to the list of factors\\nreturn results # return the entire list\\nIn contrast, an implementation of a generator for computing those factors could be\\nimplemented as follows:\\ndeffactors(n): # generator that computes factors\\nforkinrange(1,n+1):\\nifn%k= =0 : # divides evenly, thus k is a factor\\nyieldk # yield this factor as next result\\nNotice use of the keyword yield rather than return to indicate a result. This indi-\\ncates to Python that we are deﬁning a generator, rather than a traditional function. It\\nis illegal to combine yield andreturn statements in the same implementation, other\\nthan a zero-argument return statement to cause a generator to end its execution. If\\na programmer writes a loop such as forfactorinfactors(100): , an instance of our\\ngenerator is created. For each iteration of the loop, Python executes our procedure'),\n",

Iterators and Generators 41\\nuntil a yield statement indicates the next value. At that point, the procedure is tem-\\nporarily interrupted, only to be resumed when another value is requested. When\\nthe ﬂow of control naturally reaches the end of our procedure (or a zero-argumentreturn statement), a StopIteration exception is automatically raised. Although this\\nparticular example uses a single yield statement in the source code, a generator can\\nrely on multiple yield statements in different constructs, with the generated series\\ndetermined by the natural ﬂow of control. For example, we can greatly improvethe efﬁciency of our generator for computing factors of a number, n, by only test-\\ning values up to the square root of that number, while reporting the factor n//k\\nthat is associated with each k(unless n//kequals k). We might implement such a\\ngenerator as follows:\\ndeffactors(n): # generator that computes factors\\nk=1while k\\nk<n: # while k <sqrt(n)\\nifn%k= =0 :\\nyieldk\\nyieldn/ /k\\nk+ =1\\nifk\\nk= =n : # special case if n is perfect square\\nyieldk\\nWe should note that this generator differs from our ﬁrst version in that the factorsare not generated in strictly increasing order. For example, factors(100) generates\\nthe series 1 ,100,2,50,4,25,5,20,10.\\nIn closing, we wish to emphasize the beneﬁts of lazy evaluation when using a\\ngenerator rather than a traditional function. The results are only computed if re-quested, and the entire series need not reside in memory at one time. In fact, a\\ngenerator can effectively produce an inﬁnite series of values. As an example, the\\nFibonacci numbers form a classic mathematical sequence, starting with value 0,then value 1, and then each subsequent value being the sum of the two precedingvalues. Hence, the Fibonacci series begins as: 0 ,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,.... The follow-\\ning generator produces this inﬁnite series.\\ndefﬁbonacci():\\na=0b=1\\nwhile True : # keep going...\\nyielda # report value, a, during this pass\\nf u t u r e=a+b\\na=b # this will be next value reported\\nb = future # and subsequently this'),\n",

Each of these syntaxes provide functionality\\nthat could otherwise be accomplished using functionality that we have introduced\\nearlier in this chapter. However, at times, the new syntax is a more clear and directexpression of the logic.\\n1.9.1 Conditional Expressions\\nPython supports a conditional expression syntax that can replace a simple control\\nstructure. The general syntax is an expression of the form:\\nexpr1ifcondition else expr2\\nThis compound expression evaluates to expr1 if the condition is true, and otherwise\\nevaluates to expr2 . For those familiar with Java or C++, this is equivalent to the\\nsyntax, condition ?expr1 :expr2 , in those languages.\\nAs an example, consider the goal of sending the absolute value of a variable, n,\\nto a function (and without relying on the built-in absfunction, for the sake of ex-\\nample). Using a traditional control structure, we might accomplish this as follows:\\nifn>=0 :\\nparam = n\\nelse:\\nparam = −n\\nresult = foo(param) # call the function\\nWith the conditional expression syntax, we can directly assign a value to variable,param , as follows:\\nparam = n ifn>=0else−n # pick the appropriate value\\nresult = foo(param) # call the function\\nIn fact, there is no need to assign the compound expression to a variable. A condi-\\ntional expression can itself serve as a parameter to the function, written as follows:\\nresult = foo(n ifn>=0else−n)\\nSometimes, the mere shortening of source code is advantageous because it\\navoids the distraction of a more cumbersome control structure. However, we rec-\\nommend that a conditional expression be used only when it improves the readabilityof the source code, and when the ﬁrst of the two options is the more “natural” case,given its prominence in the syntax. (We prefer to view the alternative value as more\\nexceptional.)'),\n",

Additional Python Conveniences 43\\n1.9.2 Comprehension Syntax\\nA very common programming task is to produce one series of values based upon\\nthe processing of another series. Often, this task can be accomplished quite simplyin Python using what is known as a comprehension syntax . We begin by demon-\\nstrating list comprehension , as this was the ﬁrst form to be supported by Python.\\nIts general form is as follows:\\n[expression for valueiniterable ifcondition ]\\nWe note that both expression and condition may depend on value , and that the\\nif-clause is optional. The evaluation of the comprehension is logically equivalentto the following traditional control structure for computing a resulting list:\\nresult = [ ]for valueiniterable :\\nifcondition:\\nresult.append( expression )\\nAs a concrete example, a list of the squares of the numbers from 1 to n,t h a ti s\\n[1,4,9,16,25,..., n\\n2], can be created by traditional means as follows:\\nsquares = [ ]\\nforkinrange(1, n+1):\\nsquares.append(k\\n k)\\nWith list comprehension, this logic is expressed as follows:\\nsquares = [k\\n kforkinrange(1, n+1)]\\nAs a second example, Section 1.8 introduced the goal of producing a list of factors\\nfor an integer n. That task is accomplished with the following list comprehension:\\nfactors = [k forkinrange(1,n+1) ifn%k= =0 ]\\nPython supports similar comprehension syntaxes that respectively produce a\\nset, generator, or dictionary. We compare those syntaxes using our example forproducing the squares of numbers.\\n[k\\nkforkinrange(1, n+1) ] list comprehension\\n{k\\nkforkinrange(1, n+1) } set comprehension\\n(k\\nkforkinrange(1, n+1) ) generator comprehension\\n{k:k\\nkforkinrange(1, n+1) } dictionary comprehension\\nThe generator syntax is particularly attractive when results do not need to be storedin memory. For example, to compute the sum of the ﬁrst nsquares, the genera-\\ntor syntax, total = sum(k\\nkforkinrange(1, n+1)) , is preferred to the use of an\\nexplicitly instantiated list comprehension as the parameter.'),\n",

Python Primer\\n1.9.3 Packing and Unpacking of Sequences\\nPython provides two additional conveniences involving the treatment of tuples and\\nother sequence types. The ﬁrst is rather cosmetic. If a series of comma-separatedexpressions are given in a larger context, they will be treated as a single tuple, evenif no enclosing parentheses are provided. For example, the assignment\\nd a t a=2 ,4 ,6 ,8\\nresults in identiﬁer, data, being assigned to the tuple ( 2 ,4 ,6 ,8 ) .T h i s b e h a v i o r\\nis called automatic packing of a tuple. One common use of packing in Python is\\nwhen returning multiple values from a function. If the body of a function executesthe command,\\nreturn x, y\\nit will be formally returning a single object that is the tuple (x, y) .\\nAs a dual to the packing behavior, Python can automatically unpack a se-\\nquence, allowing one to assign a series of individual identiﬁers to the elementsof sequence. As an example, we can write\\na, b, c, d = range(7, 11)\\nwhich has the effect of assigning a=7,b=8,c=9,a n dd=10 , as those are the four\\nvalues in the sequence returned by the call to range . For this syntax, the right-hand\\nside expression can be any iterable type, as long as the number of variables on the\\nleft-hand side is the same as the number of elements in the iteration.\\nThis technique can be used to unpack tuples returned by a function. For exam-\\nple, the built-in function, divmod(a, b) , returns the pair of values (a // b, a % b)\\nassociated with an integer division. Although the caller can consider the return\\nvalue to be a single tuple, it is possible to write\\nquotient, remainder = divmod(a, b)\\nto separately identify the two entries of the returned tuple. This syntax can also beused in the context of a for loop, when iterating over a sequence of iterables, as in\\nforx, yin[ (7, 2), (5, 8), (6, 4) ]:\\nIn this example, there will be three iterations of the loop. During the ﬁrst pass, x=7\\nandy=2, and so on. This style of loop is quite commonly used to iterate through\\nkey-value pairs that are returned by the items() method of the dictclass, as in:\\nfork, vinmapping.items():'),\n",

Additional Python Conveniences 45\\nSimultaneous Assignments\\nThe combination of automatic packing and unpacking forms a technique known\\nassimultaneous assignment , whereby we explicitly assign a series of values to a\\nseries of identiﬁers, using a syntax:\\nx, y, z = 6, 2, 5\\nIn effect, the right-hand side of this assignment is automatically packed into a tuple,and then automatically unpacked with its elements assigned to the three identiﬁerson the left-hand side.\\nWhen using a simultaneous assignment, all of the expressions are evaluated\\non the right-hand side before any of the assignments are made to the left-handvariables. This is signiﬁcant, as it provides a convenient means for swapping thevalues associated with two variables:\\nj, k = k, j\\nWith this command, jwill be assigned to the oldvalue of k,a n dkwill be assigned\\nto the oldvalue of j. Without simultaneous assignment, a swap typically requires\\nmore delicate use of a temporary variable, such as\\ntemp = jj=kk=t e m p\\nWith the simultaneous assignment, the unnamed tuple representing the packed val-ues on the right-hand side implicitly serves as the temporary variable when per-\\nforming such a swap.\\nThe use of simultaneous assignments can greatly simplify the presentation of\\ncode. As an example, we reconsider the generator on page 41 that produces the\\nFibonacci series. The original code requires separate initialization of variables a\\nandbto begin the series. Within each pass of the loop, the goal was to reassign a\\nandb, respectively, to the values of banda+b. At the time, we accomplished this\\nwith brief use of a third variable. With simultaneous assignments, that generatorcan be implemented more directly as follows:\\ndefﬁbonacci():\\na, b = 0, 1while True :\\nyielda\\na, b = b, a+b'),\n",

Python Primer\\n1.10 Scopes and Namespaces\\nWhen computing a sum with the syntax x+y in Python, the names xandymust\\nhave been previously associated with objects that serve as values; a NameError\\nwill be raised if no such deﬁnitions are found. The process of determining the\\nvalue associated with an identiﬁer is known as name resolution .\\nWhenever an identiﬁer is assigned to a value, that deﬁnition is made with a\\nspeciﬁc scope . Top-level assignments are typically made in what is known as global\\nscope. Assignments made within the body of a function typically have scope that is\\nlocal to that function call. Therefore, an assignment, x=5 , within a function has\\nno effect on the identiﬁer, x, in the broader scope.\\nEach distinct scope in Python is represented using an abstraction known as a\\nnamespace . A namespace manages all identiﬁers that are currently deﬁned in a\\ngiven scope. Figure 1.8 portrays two namespaces, one being that of a caller to our\\ncount function from Section 1.5, and the other being the local namespace during\\nthe execution of that function.\\nA-\\nstr\\nA\\nstr\\nCS\\nﬂoat\\n3.56int\\n2\\nitemdatagrades\\nmajorgpatargetn\\nlist\\nstr\\nB+\\nstr\\nA-\\nstr\\nFigure 1.8: A portrayal of the two namespaces associated with a user’s call\\ncount(grades,\\n A\\n), as deﬁned in Section 1.5. The left namespace is the caller’s\\nand the right namespace represents the local scope of the function.\\nPython implements a namespace with its own dictionary that maps each iden-\\ntifying string (e.g.,\\n n\\n) to its associated value. Python provides several ways to\\nexamine a given namespace. The function, dir, reports the names of the identiﬁers\\nin a given namespace (i.e., the keys of the dictionary), while the function, vars,\\nreturns the full dictionary. By default, calls to dir() andvars() report on the most\\nlocally enclosing namespace in which they are executed.'),\n",

Scopes and Namespaces 47\\nWhen an identiﬁer is indicated in a command, Python searches a series of\\nnamespaces in the process of name resolution. First, the most locally enclosing\\nscope is searched for a given name. If not found there, the next outer scope issearched, and so on. We will continue our examination of namespaces, in Sec-tion 2.5, when discussing Python’s treatment of object-orientation. We will seethat each object has its own namespace to store its attributes, and that classes each\\nhave a namespace as well.\\nFirst-Class Objects\\nIn the terminology of programming languages, ﬁrst-class objects are instances of\\na type that can be assigned to an identiﬁer, passed as a parameter, or returned by\\na function. All of the data types we introduced in Section 1.2.3, such as intand\\nlist, are clearly ﬁrst-class types in Python. In Python, functions and classes are also\\ntreated as ﬁrst-class objects. For example, we could write the following:\\nscream = print # assign name ’scream’ to the function denoted as ’print’\\nscream(\\n Hello\\n )# call that function\\nIn this case, we have not created a new function, we have simply deﬁned scream\\nas an alias for the existing print function. While there is little motivation for pre-\\ncisely this example, it demonstrates the mechanism that is used by Python to al-\\nlow one function to be passed as a parameter to another. On page 28, we noted\\nthat the built-in function, max, accepts an optional keyword parameter to specify\\na non-default order when computing a maximum. For example, a caller can use\\nthe syntax, max(a, b, key=abs) , to determine which value has the larger absolute\\nvalue. Within the body of that function, the formal parameter, key, is an identiﬁer\\nthat will be assigned to the actual parameter, abs.\\nIn terms of namespaces, an assignment such as scream = print , introduces the\\nidentiﬁer, scream , into the current namespace, with its value being the object that\\nrepresents the built-in function, print . The same mechanism is applied when a user-\\ndeﬁned function is declared. For example, our count function from Section 1.5\\nbeings with the following syntax:\\ndefcount(data, target):\\n...\\nSuch a declaration introduces the identiﬁer, count , into the current namespace,\\nwith the value being a function instance representing its implementation. In similarfashion, the name of a newly deﬁned class is associated with a representation of\\nthat class as its value. (Class deﬁnitions will be introduced in the next chapter.)'),\n",

Python Primer\\n1.11 Modules and the Import Statement\\nWe have already introduced many functions (e.g., max) and classes (e.g., list)\\nthat are deﬁned within Python’s built-in namespace. Depending on the version of\\nPython, there are approximately 130–150 deﬁnitions that were deemed signiﬁcantenough to be included in that built-in namespace.\\nBeyond the built-in deﬁnitions, the standard Python distribution includes per-\\nhaps tens of thousands of other values, functions, and classes that are organized inadditional libraries, known as modules , that can be imported from within a pro-\\ngram. As an example, we consider the math module. While the built-in namespace\\nincludes a few mathematical functions (e.g., abs,min,max,round ), many more\\nare relegated to the math module (e.g., sin,cos,sqrt). That module also deﬁnes\\napproximate values for the mathematical constants, piande.\\nPython’s import statement loads deﬁnitions from a module into the current\\nnamespace. One form of an import statement uses a syntax such as the following:\\nfrommathimport pi, sqrt\\nThis command adds both piandsqrt, as deﬁned in the math module, into the cur-\\nrent namespace, allowing direct use of the identiﬁer, pi, or a call of the function,\\nsqrt(2) . If there are many deﬁnitions from the same module to be imported, an\\nasterisk may be used as a wild card, as in, frommathimport\\n, but this form\\nshould be used sparingly. The danger is that some of the names deﬁned in the mod-ule may conﬂict with names already in the current namespace (or being importedfrom another module), and the import causes the new deﬁnitions to replace existingones.\\nAnother approach that can be used to access many deﬁnitions from the same\\nmodule is to import the module itself, using a syntax such as:\\nimport math\\nFormally, this adds the identiﬁer, math , to the current namespace, with the module\\nas its value. (Modules are also ﬁrst-class objects in Python.) Once imported, in-dividual deﬁnitions from the module can be accessed using a fully-qualiﬁed name,\\nsuch as math.pi ormath.sqrt(2) .\\nCreating a New Module\\nTo create a new module, one simply has to put the relevant deﬁnitions in a ﬁle\\nnamed with a .py sufﬁx. Those deﬁnitions can be imported from any other .py\\nﬁle within the same project directory. For example, if we were to put the deﬁnitionof our count function (see Section 1.5) into a ﬁle named utility.py, we could\\nimport that function using the syntax, fromutilityimport count .'),\n",

Modules and the Import Statement 49\\nIt is worth noting that top-level commands with the module source code are\\nexecuted when the module is ﬁrst imported, almost as if the module were its own\\nscript. There is a special construct for embedding commands within the modulethat will be executed if the module is directly invoked as a script, but not whenthe module is imported from another script. Such commands should be placed in abody of a conditional statement of the following form,\\nif\\nname\\n ==\\n __main__\\n :\\nUsing our hypothetical utility.py module as an example, such commands will\\nbe executed if the interpreter is started with a command python utility.py,b u t\\nnot when the utility module is imported into another context. This approach is often\\nused to embed what are known as unit tests within the module; we will discuss unit\\ntesting further in Section 2.2.4.\\n1.11.1 Existing Modules\\nTable 1.7 provides a summary of a few available modules that are relevant to a\\nstudy of data structures.

Indeed, a simple yet popular pseudo-random number generator chooses its\\nnext number based solely on the most recently chosen number and some additionalparameters using the following formula.\\nnext =(a*current +b)%n;\\nwhere a,b,a n d nare appropriately chosen integers. Python uses a more advanced\\ntechnique known as a Mersenne twister . It turns out that the sequences generated\\nby these techniques can be proven to be statistically uniform, which is usually\\ngood enough for most applications requiring random numbers, such as games. For\\napplications, such as computer security settings, where one needs unpredictablerandom sequences, this kind of formula should not be used. Instead, one shouldideally sample from a source that is actually random, such as radio static coming\\nfrom outer space.\\nSince the next number in a pseudo-random generator is determined by the pre-\\nvious number(s), such a generator always needs a place to start, which is called its\\nseed. The sequence of numbers generated for a given seed will always be the same.\\nOne common trick to get a different sequence each time a program is run is to use\\na seed that will be different for each run. For example, we could use some timed\\ninput from a user or the current system time in milliseconds.\\nPython’s random module provides support for pseudo-random number gener-\\nation by deﬁning a Random class; instances of that class serve as generators with\\nindependent state. This allows different aspects of a program to rely on their ownpseudo-random number generator, so that calls to one generator do not affect thesequence of numbers produced by another.

Goals, Principles, and Patterns 57\\n2.1 Goals, Principles, and Patterns\\nAs the name implies, the main “actors” in the object-oriented paradigm are called\\nobjects . Each object is an instance of a class . Each class presents to the outside\\nworld a concise and consistent view of the objects that are instances of this class,without going into too much unnecessary detail or giving others access to the inner\\nworkings of the objects. The class deﬁnition typically speciﬁes instance variables ,\\nalso known as data members , that the object contains, as well as the methods ,a l s o\\nknown as member functions , that the object can execute. This view of computing\\nis intended to fulﬁll several goals and incorporate several design principles, whichwe discuss in this chapter.\\n2.1.1 Object-Oriented Design Goals\\nSoftware implementations should achieve robustness ,adaptability ,a n d reusabil-\\nity. (See Figure 2.1.)\\nRobustness Adaptability Reusability\\nFigure 2.1: Goals of object-oriented design.\\nRobustness\\nEvery good programmer wants to develop software that is correct, which means that\\na program produces the right output for all the anticipated inputs in the program’s\\napplication. In addition, we want software to be robust , that is, capable of handling\\nunexpected inputs that are not explicitly deﬁned for its application. For example,\\nif a program is expecting a positive integer (perhaps representing the price of anitem) and instead is given a negative integer, then the program should be able to\\nrecover gracefully from this error. More importantly, in life-critical applications ,\\nwhere a software error can lead to injury or loss of life, software that is not robust\\ncould be deadly. This point was driven home in the late 1980s in accidents involv-ing Therac-25, a radiation-therapy machine, which severely overdosed six patientsbetween 1985 and 1987, some of whom died from complications resulting from\\ntheir radiation overdose. All six accidents were traced to software errors.'),\n",

Object-Oriented Programming\\nAdaptability\\nModern software applications, such as Web browsers and Internet search engines,\\ntypically involve large programs that are used for many years. Software, there-\\nfore, needs to be able to evolve over time in response to changing conditions in its\\nenvironment. Thus, another important goal of quality software is that it achievesadaptability (also called evolvability ). Related to this concept is portability ,w h i c h\\nis the ability of software to run with minimal change on different hardware andoperating system platforms. An advantage of writing software in Python is the\\nportability provided by the language itself.\\nReusability\\nGoing hand in hand with adaptability is the desire that software be reusable, that\\nis, the same code should be usable as a component of different systems in variousapplications. Developing quality software can be an expensive enterprise, and itscost can be offset somewhat if the software is designed in a way that makes it easilyreusable in future applications. Such reuse should be done with care, however, for\\none of the major sources of software errors in the Therac-25 came from inappropri-\\nate reuse of Therac-20 software (which was not object-oriented and not designedfor the hardware platform used with the Therac-25).\\n2.1.2 Object-Oriented Design Principles\\nChief among the principles of the object-oriented approach, which are intended tofacilitate the goals outlined above, are the following (see Figure 2.2):\\n•Modularity\\n•Abstraction\\n•Encapsulation\\nModularity Abstraction Encapsulation\\nFigure 2.2: Principles of object-oriented design.'),\n",

Goals, Principles, and Patterns 59\\nModularity\\nModern software systems typically consist of several different components that\\nmust interact correctly in order for the entire system to work properly. Keepingthese interactions straight requires that these different components be well orga-\\nnized. Modularity refers to an organizing principle in which different components\\nof a software system are divided into separate functional units.\\nAs a real-world analogy, a house or apartment can be viewed as consisting of\\nseveral interacting units: electrical, heating and cooling, plumbing, and structural.Rather than viewing these systems as one giant jumble of wires, vents, pipes, andboards, the organized architect designing a house or apartment will view them asseparate modules that interact in well-deﬁned ways. In so doing, he or she is usingmodularity to bring a clarity of thought that provides a natural way of organizing\\nfunctions into distinct manageable units.\\nIn like manner, using modularity in a software system can also provide a pow-\\nerful organizing framework that brings clarity to an implementation. In Python,we have already seen that a module is a collection of closely related functions and\\nclasses that are deﬁned together in a single ﬁle of source code. Python’s standard\\nlibraries include, for example, the math module, which provides deﬁnitions for key\\nmathematical constants and functions, and the osmodule, which provides support\\nfor interacting with the operating system.\\nThe use of modularity helps support the goals listed in Section 2.1.1. Robust-\\nness is greatly increased because it is easier to test and debug separate componentsbefore they are integrated into a larger software system. Furthermore, bugs that per-\\nsist in a complete system might be traced to a particular component, which can be\\nﬁxed in relative isolation. The structure imposed by modularity also helps enablesoftware reusability. If software modules are written in a general way, the modulescan be reused when related need arises in other contexts. This is particularly rel-\\nevant in a study of data structures, which can typically be designed with sufﬁcient\\nabstraction and generality to be reused in many applications.\\nAbstraction\\nThe notion of abstraction is to distill a complicated system down to its most funda-\\nmental parts. Typically, describing the parts of a system involves naming them and\\nexplaining their functionality. Applying the abstraction paradigm to the design of\\ndata structures gives rise to abstract data types (ADTs). An ADT is a mathematical\\nmodel of a data structure that speciﬁes the type of data stored, the operations sup-ported on them, and the types of parameters of the operations. An ADT speciﬁeswhat each operation does, but not how it does it. We will typically refer to the\\ncollective set of behaviors supported by an ADT as its public interface .'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Michel T.Goodrich ,Roberto Tamassia, Michel H.Gold wasser, Data Structures and Algorithms in Python.pdf', 'page': 81}, page_content='60 Chapter 2. Object-Oriented Programming\\nAs a programming language, Python provides a great deal of latitude in regard\\nto the speciﬁcation of an interface. Python has a tradition of treating abstractions\\nimplicitly using a mechanism known as duck typing . As an interpreted and dy-\\nnamically typed language, there is no “compile time” checking of data types inPython, and no formal requirement for declarations of abstract base classes. In-stead programmers assume that an object supports a set of known behaviors, with\\nthe interpreter raising a run-time error if those assumptions fail. The description\\nof this as “duck typing” comes from an adage attributed to poet James WhitcombRiley, stating that “when I see a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duckand quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck.”\\nMore formally, Python supports abstract data types using a mechanism known\\nas an abstract base class (ABC). An abstract base class cannot be instantiated\\n(i.e., you cannot directly create an instance of that class), but it deﬁnes one or morecommon methods that all implementations of the abstraction must have. An ABCis realized by one or more concrete classes that inherit from the abstract base class\\nwhile providing implementations for those method declared by the ABC. Python’s\\nabcmodule provides formal support for ABCs, although we omit such declarations\\nfor simplicity. We will make use of several existing abstract base classes coming\\nfrom Python’s collections module, which includes deﬁnitions for several common\\ndata structure ADTs, and concrete implementations of some of those abstractions.\\nEncapsulation\\nAnother important principle of object-oriented design is encapsulation . Different\\ncomponents of a software system should not reveal the internal details of theirrespective implementations. One of the main advantages of encapsulation is that it\\ngives one programmer freedom to implement the details of a component, without\\nconcern that other programmers will be writing code that intricately depends onthose internal decisions. The only constraint on the programmer of a componentis to maintain the public interface for the component, as other programmers willbe writing code that depends on that interface. Encapsulation yields robustness\\nand adaptability, for it allows the implementation details of parts of a program to\\nchange without adversely affecting other parts, thereby making it easier to ﬁx bugsor add new functionality with relatively local changes to a component.\\nThroughout this book, we will adhere to the principle of encapsulation, making\\nclear which aspects of a data structure are assumed to be public and which are\\nassumed to be internal details. With that said, Python provides only loose support\\nfor encapsulation. By convention, names of members of a class (both data membersand member functions) that start with a single underscore character (e.g.,\\nsecret )\\nare assumed to be nonpublic and should not be relied upon. Those conventionsare reinforced by the intentional omission of those members from automatically\\ngenerated documentation.'),\n",

Goals, Principles, and Patterns 61\\n2.1.3 Design Patterns\\nObject-oriented design facilitates reusable, robust, and adaptable software. De-\\nsigning good code takes more than simply understanding object-oriented method-\\nologies, however. It requires the effective use of object-oriented design techniques.\\nComputing researchers and practitioners have developed a variety of organiza-\\ntional concepts and methodologies for designing quality object-oriented softwarethat is concise, correct, and reusable. Of special relevance to this book is the con-cept of a design pattern , which describes a solution to a “typical” software design\\nproblem. A pattern provides a general template for a solution that can be applied in\\nmany different situations. It describes the main elements of a solution in an abstract\\nway that can be specialized for a speciﬁc problem at hand. It consists of a name,which identiﬁes the pattern; a context, which describes the scenarios for which thispattern can be applied; a template, which describes how the pattern is applied; and\\na result, which describes and analyzes what the pattern produces.\\nWe present several design patterns in this book, and we show how they can be\\nconsistently applied to implementations of data structures and algorithms. These\\ndesign patterns fall into two groups—patterns for solving algorithm design prob-lems and patterns for solving software engineering problems. The algorithm designpatterns we discuss include the following:\\n•Recursion (Chapter 4)\\n•Amortization (Sections 5.3 and 11.4)\\n•Divide-and-conquer (Section 12.2.1)\\n•Prune-and-search, also known as decrease-and-conquer (Section 12.7.1)\\n•Brute force (Section 13.2.1)\\n•Dynamic programming (Section 13.3).\\n•The greedy method (Sections 13.4.2, 14.6.2, and 14.7)\\nLikewise, the software engineering design patterns we discuss include:\\n•Iterator (Sections 1.8 and 2.3.4)\\n•Adapter (Section 6.1.2)\\n•Position (Sections 7.4 and 8.1.2)\\n•Composition (Sections 7.6.1, 9.2.1, and 10.1.4)\\n•Template method (Sections 2.4.3, 8.4.6, 10.1.3, 10.5.2, and 11.2.1)\\n•Locator (Section 9.5.1)\\n•Factory method (Section 11.2.1)\\nRather than explain each of these concepts here, however, we introduce them\\nthroughout the text as noted above. For each pattern, be it for algorithm engineeringor software engineering, we explain its general use and we illustrate it with at least\\none concrete example.'),\n",

Object-Oriented Programming\\n2.2 Software Development\\nTraditional software development involves several phases. Three major steps are:\\n1. Design\\n2. Implementation\\n3. Testing and Debugging\\nIn this section, we brieﬂy discuss the role of these phases, and we introduce sev-\\neral good practices for programming in Python, including coding style, naming\\nconventions, formal documentation, and unit testing.\\n2.2.1 Design\\nFor object-oriented programming, the design step is perhaps the most important\\nphase in the process of developing software. For it is in the design step that wedecide how to divide the workings of our program into classes, we decide how\\nthese classes will interact, what data each will store, and what actions each will\\nperform. Indeed, one of the main challenges that beginning programmers face isdeciding what classes to deﬁne to do the work of their program. While generalprescriptions are hard to come by, there are some rules of thumb that we can applywhen determining how to design our classes:\\n•Responsibilities : Divide the work into different actors , each with a different\\nresponsibility. Try to describe responsibilities using action verbs. Theseactors will form the classes for the program.\\n•Independence : Deﬁne the work for each class to be as independent from\\nother classes as possible. Subdivide responsibilities between classes so thateach class has autonomy over some aspect of the program. Give data (as in-stance variables) to the class that has jurisdiction over the actions that requireaccess to this data.\\n•Behaviors : Deﬁne the behaviors for each class carefully and precisely, so\\nthat the consequences of each action performed by a class will be well un-derstood by other classes that interact with it. These behaviors will deﬁnethe methods that this class performs, and the set of behaviors for a class aretheinterface to the class, as these form the means for other pieces of code to\\ninteract with objects from the class.\\nDeﬁning the classes, together with their instance variables and methods, are keyto the design of an object-oriented program. A good programmer will naturallydevelop greater skill in performing these tasks over time, as experience teacheshim or her to notice patterns in the requirements of a program that match patterns\\nthat he or she has seen before.'),\n",

Software Development 63\\nA common tool for developing an initial high-level design for a project is the\\nuse of CRC cards . Class-Responsibility-Collaborator (CRC) cards are simple in-\\ndex cards that subdivide the work required of a program. The main idea behind this\\ntool is to have each card represent a component, which will ultimately become aclass in the program. We write the name of each component on the top of an indexcard. On the left-hand side of the card, we begin writing the responsibilities for\\nthis component. On the right-hand side, we list the collaborators for this compo-\\nnent, that is, the other components that this component will have to interact with toperform its duties.\\nThe design process iterates through an action/actor cycle, where we ﬁrst iden-\\ntify an action (that is, a responsibility), and we then determine an actor (that is, a\\ncomponent) that is best suited to perform that action. The design is complete when\\nwe have assigned all actions to actors. In using index cards for this process (ratherthan larger pieces of paper), we are relying on the fact that each component shouldhave a small set of responsibilities and collaborators. Enforcing this rule helps keep\\nthe individual classes manageable.\\nAs the design takes form, a standard approach to explain and document the\\ndesign is the use of UML (Uniﬁed Modeling Language) diagrams to express the\\norganization of a program. UML diagrams are a standard visual notation to expressobject-oriented software designs. Several computer-aided tools are available to\\nbuild UML diagrams. One type of UML ﬁgure is known as a class diagram .A n\\nexample of such a diagram is given in Figure 2.3, for a class that represents a\\nconsumer credit card. The diagram has three portions, with the ﬁrst designatingthe name of the class, the second designating the recommended instance variables,and the third designating the recommended methods of the class. In Section 2.2.3,\\nwe discuss our naming conventions, and in Section 2.3.1, we provide a complete\\nimplementation of a Python CreditCard class based on this design.\\nClass:\\nFields:\\nBehaviors:\\nmake\\n payment(amount)\\ncustomer\\naccount\\nget\\ncustomer()\\nget\\nbank()\\nbank\\nget\\naccount()\\nbalance\\nlimit\\nget\\nbalance()\\nget\\nlimit()CreditCard\\ncharge(price)\\nFigure 2.3: Class diagram for a proposed CreditCard class.'),\n",

Object-Oriented Programming\\n2.2.2 Pseudo-Code\\nAs an intermediate step before the implementation of a design, programmers are\\noften asked to describe algorithms in a way that is intended for human eyes only.Such descriptions are called pseudo-code . Pseudo-code is not a computer program,\\nbut is more structured than usual prose. It is a mixture of natural language and\\nhigh-level programming constructs that describe the main ideas behind a generic\\nimplementation of a data structure or algorithm. Because pseudo-code is designedfor a human reader, not a computer, we can communicate high-level ideas, withoutbeing burdened with low-level implementation details. At the same time, we shouldnot gloss over important steps. Like many forms of human communication, ﬁnding\\nthe right balance is an important skill that is reﬁned through practice.\\nIn this book, we rely on a pseudo-code style that we hope will be evident to\\nPython programmers, yet with a mix of mathematical notations and English prose.\\nFor example, we might use the phrase “indicate an error” rather than a formal raise\\nstatement. Following conventions of Python, we rely on indentation to indicatethe extent of control structures and on an indexing notation in which entries of a\\nsequence Awith length nare indexed from A[0]toA[n−1]. However, we choose\\nto enclose comments within curly braces {like these }in our pseudo-code, rather\\nthan using Python’s #character.\\n2.2.3 Coding Style and Documentation\\nPrograms should be made easy to read and understand. Good programmers shouldtherefore be mindful of their coding style, and develop a style that communicates\\nthe important aspects of a program’s design for both humans and computers. Con-ventions for coding style tend to vary between different programming communities.The ofﬁcial Style Guide for Python Code is available online at\\nhttp://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/\\nThe main principles that we adopt are as follows:\\n•Python code blocks are typically indented by 4 spaces. However, to avoidhaving our code fragments overrun the book’s margins, we use 2 spaces foreach level of indentation. It is strongly recommended that tabs be avoided, astabs are displayed with differing widths across systems, and tabs and spacesare not viewed as identical by the Python interpreter. Many Python-aware\\neditors will automatically replace tabs with an appropriate number of spaces.'),\n",

Software Development 65\\n•Use meaningful names for identiﬁers. Try to choose names that can be read\\naloud, and choose names that reﬂect the action, responsibility, or data each\\nidentiﬁer is naming.\\n◦Classes (other than Python’s built-in classes) should have a name thatserves as a singular noun, and should be capitalized (e.g., Date rather\\nthandate orDates ). When multiple words are concatenated to form a\\nclass name, they should follow the so-called “CamelCase” conventionin which the ﬁrst letter of each word is capitalized (e.g., CreditCard ).\\n◦Functions, including member functions of a class, should be lowercase.If multiple words are combined, they should be separated by under-\\nscores (e.g., make\\npayment ). The name of a function should typically\\nbe a verb that describes its affect. However, if the only purpose of the\\nfunction is to return a value, the function name may be a noun thatdescribes the value (e.g., sqrtrather than calculate\\nsqrt).\\n◦Names that identify an individual object (e.g., a parameter, instancevariable, or local variable) should be a lowercase noun (e.g., price ).\\nOccasionally, we stray from this rule when using a single uppercaseletter to designate the name of a data structures (such as tree T).\\n◦Identiﬁers that represent a value considered to be a constant are tradi-tionally identiﬁed using all capital letters and with underscores to sep-arate words (e.g., MAX\\nSIZE ).\\nRecall from our discussion of encapsulation that identiﬁers in any context\\nthat begin with a single leading underscore (e.g.,\\n secret ) are intended to\\nsuggest that they are only for “internal” use to a class or module, and not partof a public interface.\\n•Use comments that add meaning to a program and explain ambiguous orconfusing constructs. In-line comments are good for quick explanations;they are indicated in Python following the #character, as in\\nifn%2= =1 : #ni so d d\\nMultiline block comments are good for explaining more complex code sec-tions. In Python, these are technically multiline string literals, typically de-\\nlimited with triple quotes ( ”””), which have no effect when executed. In the\\nnext section, we discuss the use of block comments for documentation.'),\n",

Formally, any string literal\\nthat appears as the ﬁrststatement within the body of a module, class, or function\\n(including a member function of a class) will be considered to be a docstring. By\\nconvention, those string literals should be delimited within triple quotes ( ”””).

More detailed docstringsshould begin with a single line that summarizes the purpose, followed by a blankline, and then further details. For example, we might more clearly document thescale function as follows:\\ndefscale(data, factor):\\n”””Multiply all entries of numeric data list by the given factor.\\ndata an instance of any mutable sequence type (such as a list)\\ncontaining numeric elements\\nfactor a number that serves as the multiplicative factor for scaling\\n”””\\nforjinrange(len(data)):\\ndata[j]\\n=f a c t o r\\nA docstring is stored as a ﬁeld of the module, function, or class in which it\\nis declared. It serves as documentation and can be retrieved in a variety of ways.\\nFor example, the command help(x) , within the Python interpreter, produces the\\ndocumentation associated with the identiﬁed object x. An external tool named\\npydoc is distributed with Python and can be used to generate formal documentation\\nas text or as a Web page. Guidelines for authoring useful docstrings are available\\nat:\\nhttp://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/\\nIn this book, we will try to present docstrings when space allows.

Testing and debugging are often the most time-consuming\\nactivity in the development of a program.\\nTesting\\nA careful testing plan is an essential part of writing a program. While verifying the\\ncorrectness of a program over all possible inputs is usually infeasible, we shouldaim at executing the program on a representative subset of inputs. At the very\\nminimum, we should make sure that every method of a class is tested at least once\\n(method coverage). Even better, each code statement in the program should beexecuted at least once (statement coverage).\\nPrograms often tend to fail on special cases of the input. Such cases need to be\\ncarefully identiﬁed and tested. For example, when testing a method that sorts (thatis, puts in order) a sequence of integers, we should consider the following inputs:\\n•The sequence has zero length (no elements).\\n•The sequence has one element.\\n•All the elements of the sequence are the same.\\n•The sequence is already sorted.\\n•The sequence is reverse sorted.\\nIn addition to special inputs to the program, we should also consider special\\nconditions for the structures used by the program. For example, if we use a Pythonlist to store data, we should make sure that boundary cases, such as inserting orremoving at the beginning or end of the list, are properly handled.\\nWhile it is essential to use handcrafted test suites, it is also advantageous to\\nrun the program on a large collection of randomly generated inputs. The random\\nmodule in Python provides several means for generating random numbers, or forrandomizing the order of collections.\\nThe dependencies among the classes and functions of a program induce a hi-\\nerarchy. Namely, a component Ais above a component Bin the hierarchy if A\\ndepends upon B, such as when function Acalls function B, or function Arelies on\\na parameter that is an instance of class B. There are two main testing strategies,\\ntop-down andbottom-up , which differ in the order in which components are tested.\\nTop-down testing proceeds from the top to the bottom of the program hierarchy.\\nIt is typically used in conjunction with stubbing , a boot-strapping technique that\\nreplaces a lower-level component with a stub, a replacement for the component\\nthat simulates the functionality of the original. For example, if function Acalls\\nfunction Bto get the ﬁrst line of a ﬁle, when testing Awe can replace Bwith a stub\\nthat returns a ﬁxed string.'),\n",

Object-Oriented Programming\\nBottom-up testing proceeds from lower-level components to higher-level com-\\nponents. For example, bottom-level functions, which do not invoke other functions,\\nare tested ﬁrst, followed by functions that call only bottom-level functions, and soon. Similarly a class that does not depend upon any other classes can be testedbefore another class that depends on the former. This form of testing is usuallydescribed as unit testing , as the functionality of a speciﬁc component is tested in\\nisolation of the larger software project. If used properly, this strategy better isolatesthe cause of errors to the component being tested, as lower-level components uponwhich it relies should have already been thoroughly tested.\\nPython provides several forms of support for automated testing. When func-\\ntions or classes are deﬁned in a module, testing for that module can be embeddedin the same ﬁle. The mechanism for doing so was described in Section 1.11. Codethat is shielded in a conditional construct of the form\\nif\\nname\\n ==\\n __main__\\n :\\n# perform tests...\\nwill be executed when Python is invoked directly on that module, but not when themodule is imported for use in a larger software project. It is common to put testsin such a construct to test the functionality of the functions and classes speciﬁcallydeﬁned in that module.\\nMore robust support for automation of unit testing is provided by Python’s\\nunittest module. This framework allows the grouping of individual test cases into\\nlarger test suites, and provides support for executing those suites, and reporting oranalyzing the results of those tests. As software is maintained, the act of regression\\ntesting is used, whereby all previous tests are re-executed to ensure that changes to\\nthe software do not introduce new bugs in previously tested components.\\nDebugging\\nThe simplest debugging technique consists of using print statements to track the\\nvalues of variables during the execution of the program. A problem with this ap-proach is that eventually the print statements need to be removed or commentedout, so they are not executed when the software is ﬁnally released.\\nA better approach is to run the program within a debugger , which is a special-\\nized environment for controlling and monitoring the execution of a program. The\\nbasic functionality provided by a debugger is the insertion of breakpoints within\\nthe code. When the program is executed within the debugger, it stops at each\\nbreakpoint. While the program is stopped, the current value of variables can beinspected.\\nThe standard Python distribution includes a module named pdb, which provides\\ndebugging support directly within the interpreter. Most IDEs for Python, such asIDLE, provide debugging environments with graphical user interfaces.'),\n",

Class Deﬁnitions 69\\n2.3 Class Deﬁnitions\\nA class serves as the primary means for abstraction in object-oriented program-\\nming. In Python, every piece of data is represented as an instance of some class.\\nA class provides a set of behaviors in the form of member functions (also known\\nasmethods ), with implementations that are common to all instances of that class.\\nA class also serves as a blueprint for its instances, effectively determining the way\\nthat state information for each instance is represented in the form of attributes (also\\nknown as ﬁelds ,instance variables ,o rdata members ).\\n2.3.1 Example: CreditCard Class\\nAs a ﬁrst example, we provide an implementation of a CreditCard class based on\\nthe design we introduced in Figure 2.3 of Section 2.2.1. The instances deﬁned by\\ntheCreditCard class provide a simple model for traditional credit cards. They have\\nidentifying information about the customer, bank, account number, credit limit, and\\ncurrent balance. The class restricts charges that would cause a card’s balance to goover its spending limit, but it does not charge interest or late payments (we revisitsuch themes in Section 2.4.1).\\nOur code begins in Code Fragment 2.1 and continues in Code Fragment 2.2.\\nThe construct begins with the keyword, class , followed by the name of the class, a\\ncolon, and then an indented block of code that serves as the body of the class. Thebody includes deﬁnitions for all methods of the class. These methods are deﬁned as\\nfunctions, using techniques introduced in Section 1.5, yet with a special parameter,\\nnamed self, that serves to identify the particular instance upon which a member is\\ninvoked.\\nThe self Identiﬁer\\nIn Python, the selfidentiﬁer plays a key role. In the context of the CreditCard\\nclass, there can presumably be many different CreditCard instances, and each must\\nmaintain its own balance, its own credit limit, and so on. Therefore, each instancestores its own instance variables to reﬂect its current state.\\nSyntactically, selfidentiﬁes the instance upon which a method is invoked. For\\nexample, assume that a user of our class has a variable, my\\ncard, that identiﬁes\\nan instance of the CreditCard class. When the user calls my\\ncard.get\\n balance() ,\\nidentiﬁer self, within the deﬁnition of the get\\nbalance method, refers to the card\\nknown as my\\ncard by the caller. The expression, self.\\nbalance refers to an instance\\nvariable, named\\n balance , stored as part of that particular credit card’s state.'),\n",

In the caseof the CreditCard class, each object maintains ﬁve instance variables, which we\\nname:\\ncustomer ,\\nbank ,\\naccount ,\\nlimit ,a n d\\n balance . The initial values for the\\nﬁrst four of those ﬁve are provided as explicit parameters that are sent by the userwhen instantiating the credit card, and assigned within the body of the construc-tor. For example, the command, self.\\ncustomer = customer , assigns the instance\\nvariable self.\\ncustomer to the parameter customer ; note that because customer is\\nunqualiﬁed on the right-hand side, it refers to the parameter in the local namespace.'),\n",

Object-Oriented Programming\\nEncapsulation\\nBy the conventions described in Section 2.2.3, a single leading underscore in the\\nname of a data member, such as\\n balance , implies that it is intended as nonpublic .\\nUsers of a class should not directly access such members.\\nAs a general rule, we will treat all data members as nonpublic. This allows\\nus to better enforce a consistent state for all instances. We can provide accessors,\\nsuch as get\\nbalance , to provide a user of our class read-only access to a trait. If\\nwe wish to allow the user to change the state, we can provide appropriate update\\nmethods. In the context of data structures, encapsulating the internal representationallows us greater ﬂexibility to redesign the way a class works, perhaps to improve\\nthe efﬁciency of the structure.\\nAdditional Methods\\nThe most interesting behaviors in our class are charge andmake\\n payment .T h e\\ncharge function typically adds the given price to the credit card balance, to reﬂect\\na purchase of said price by the customer. However, before accepting the charge,\\nour implementation veriﬁes that the new purchase would not cause the balance toexceed the credit limit. The make\\npayment charge reﬂects the customer sending\\npayment to the bank for the given amount, thereby reducing the balance on thecard. We note that in the command, self.\\nbalance −= amount , the expression\\nself.\\nbalance is qualiﬁed with the selfidentiﬁer because it represents an instance\\nvariable of the card, while the unqualiﬁed amount represents the local parameter.\\nError Checking\\nOur implementation of the CreditCard class is not particularly robust. First, we\\nnote that we did not explicitly check the types of the parameters to charge and\\nmake\\n payment , nor any of the parameters to the constructor. If a user were to make\\na call such as visa.charge(\\n candy\\n ), our code would presumably crash when at-\\ntempting to add that parameter to the current balance. If this class were to be widelyused in a library, we might use more rigorous techniques to raise a TypeError when\\nfacing such misuse (see Section 1.7).\\nBeyond the obvious type errors, our implementation may be susceptible to log-\\nical errors. For example, if a user were allowed to charge a negative price, suchasvisa.charge( −300) , that would serve to lower the customer’s balance. This pro-\\nvides a loophole for lowering a balance without making a payment. Of course,this might be considered valid usage if modeling the credit received when a cus-tomer returns merchandise to a store. We will explore some such issues with the\\nCreditCard class in the end-of-chapter exercises.'),\n",

Object-Oriented Programming\\n2.3.2 Operator Overloading and Python’s Special Methods\\nPython’s built-in classes provide natural semantics for many operators. For ex-\\nample, the syntax a+b invokes addition for numeric types, yet concatenation for\\nsequence types. When deﬁning a new class, we must consider whether a syntaxlikea+b should be deﬁned when aorbis an instance of that class.\\nBy default, the +operator is undeﬁned for a new class. However, the author\\nof a class may provide a deﬁnition using a technique known as operator overload-\\ning. This is done by implementing a specially named method. In particular, the\\n+operator is overloaded by implementing a method named\\nadd\\n ,w h i c ht a k e s\\nthe right-hand operand as a parameter and which returns the result of the expres-sion. That is, the syntax, a+b , is converted to a method call on object aof the\\nform, a.\\nadd\\n (b). Similar specially named methods exist for other operators.\\nTable 2.1 provides a comprehensive list of such methods.\\nWhen a binary operator is applied to two instances of different types, as in\\n3\\n love me\\n , Python gives deference to the class of the leftoperand. In this\\nexample, it would effectively check if the intclass provides a sufﬁcient deﬁnition\\nfor how to multiply an instance by a string, via the\\n mul\\n method. However,\\nif that class does not implement such a behavior, Python checks the class deﬁni-tion for the right-hand operand, in the form of a special method named\\nrmul\\n(i.e., “right multiply”). This provides a way for a new user-deﬁned class to supportmixed operations that involve an instance of an existing class (given that the exist-ing class would presumably not have deﬁned a behavior involving this new class).\\nThe distinction between\\nmul\\n and\\n rmul\\n also allows a class to deﬁne dif-\\nferent semantics in cases, such as matrix multiplication, in which an operation is\\nnoncommutative (that is, A\\nxmay differ from x\\nA).\\nNon-Operator Overloads\\nIn addition to traditional operator overloading, Python relies on specially namedmethods to control the behavior of various other functionality, when applied touser-deﬁned classes. For example, the syntax, str(foo) , is formally a call to the\\nconstructor for the string class. Of course, if the parameter is an instance of a user-deﬁned class, the original authors of the string class could not have known how\\nthat instance should be portrayed. So the string constructor calls a specially named\\nmethod, foo.\\nstr\\n(), that must return an appropriate string representation.\\nSimilar special methods are used to determine how to construct an int,ﬂoat ,o r\\nbool based on a parameter from a user-deﬁned class. The conversion to a Boolean\\nvalue is particularly important, because the syntax, iffoo:, can be used even when\\nfoois not formally a Boolean value (see Section 1.4.1). For a user-deﬁned class,\\nthat condition is evaluated by the special method foo.\\n bool\\n ().'),\n",

Object-Oriented Programming\\nSeveral other top-level functions rely on calling specially named methods. For\\nexample, the standard way to determine the size of a container type is by calling\\nthe top-level lenfunction. Note well that the calling syntax, len(foo) , is not the\\ntraditional method-calling syntax with the dot operator. However, in the case of auser-deﬁned class, the top-level lenfunction relies on a call to a specially named\\nlen\\n method of that class. That is, the call len(foo) is evaluated through a\\nmethod call, foo.\\n len\\n(). When developing data structures, we will routinely\\ndeﬁne the\\n len\\n method to return a measure of the size of the structure.\\nImplied Methods\\nAs a general rule, if a particular special method is not implemented in a user-deﬁned\\nclass, the standard syntax that relies upon that method will raise an exception. For\\nexample, evaluating the expression, a+b , for instances of a user-deﬁned class\\nwithout\\n add\\n or\\nradd\\n will raise an error.\\nHowever, there are some operators that have default deﬁnitions provided by\\nPython, in the absence of special methods, and there are some operators whosedeﬁnitions are derived from others. For example, the\\nbool\\n method, which\\nsupports the syntax iffoo:, has default semantics so that every object other than\\nNone is evaluated as True . However, for container types, the\\n len\\n method is\\ntypically deﬁned to return the size of the container. If such a method exists, thenthe evaluation of bool(foo) is interpreted by default to be True for instances with\\nnonzero length, and False for instances with zero length, allowing a syntax such as\\nifwaitlist: to be used to test whether there are one or more entries in the waitlist.\\nIn Section 2.3.4, we will discuss Python’s mechanism for providing iterators\\nfor collections via the special method,\\niter\\n . With that said, if a container class\\nprovides implementations for both\\n len\\n and\\n getitem\\n , a default iteration is\\nprovided automatically (using means we describe in Section 2.3.4). Furthermore,once an iterator is deﬁned, default functionality of\\ncontains\\n is provided.\\nIn Section 1.3 we drew attention to the distinction between expression aisb\\nand expression a= =b , with the former evaluating whether identiﬁers aandbare\\naliases for the same object, and the latter testing a notion of whether the two iden-tiﬁers reference equivalent values. The notion of “equivalence” depends upon the\\ncontext of the class, and semantics is deﬁned with the\\neq\\n method. However, if\\nno implementation is given for\\n eq\\n , the syntax a= =b is legal with semantics\\nofaisb, that is, an instance is equivalent to itself and no others.\\nWe should caution that some natural implications are notautomatically pro-\\nvided by Python. For example, the\\n eq\\n method supports syntax a= =b ,b u t\\nproviding that method does not affect the evaluation of syntax a! =b .( T h e\\n ne\\nmethod should be provided, typically returning not(a == b) as a result.)

Class Deﬁnitions 77\\n2.3.3 Example: Multidimensional Vector Class\\nTo demonstrate the use of operator overloading via special methods, we provide\\nan implementation of a Vector class, representing the coordinates of a vector in a\\nmultidimensional space. For example, in a three-dimensional space, we might wishto represent a vector with coordinates ⟨5,−2,3⟩. Although it might be tempting to\\ndirectly use a Python listto represent those coordinates, a list does not provide an\\nappropriate abstraction for a geometric vector. In particular, if using lists, the ex-pression [5,−2, 3] + [1, 4, 2] results in the list [5,−2, 3, 1, 4, 2] . When working\\nwith vectors, if u=⟨5,−2,3⟩andv=⟨1,4,2⟩, one would expect the expression,\\nu+v , to return a three-dimensional vector with coordinates ⟨6,2,5⟩.\\nWe therefore deﬁne a Vector class, in Code Fragment 2.4, that provides a better\\nabstraction for the notion of a geometric vector. Internally, our vector relies uponan instance of a list, named\\ncoords , as its storage mechanism. By keeping the\\ninternal list encapsulated, we can enforce the desired public interface for instancesof our class. A demonstration of supported behaviors includes the following:\\nv = Vector(5) # construct ﬁve-dimensional <0, 0, 0, 0, 0 >\\nv[1] = 23 #<0, 23, 0, 0, 0 >(based on use of\\nsetitem\\n )\\nv[−1] = 45 #<0, 23, 0, 0, 45 >(also via\\n setitem\\n )\\nprint(v[4]) # print 45 (via\\n getitem\\n )\\nu=v+v #<0, 46, 0, 0, 90 >(via\\n add\\n)\\nprint(u) # print <0, 46, 0, 0, 90 >\\ntotal = 0\\nforentryinv: # implicit iteration via\\n len\\nand\\n getitem\\ntotal += entry\\nWe implement many of the behaviors by trivially invoking a similar behavior\\non the underlying list of coordinates. However, our implementation of\\n add\\nis customized. Assuming the two operands are vectors with the same length, thismethod creates a new vector and sets the coordinates of the new vector to be equalto the respective sum of the operands’ elements.\\nIt is interesting to note that the class deﬁnition, as given in Code Fragment 2.4,\\nautomatically supports the syntax u = v + [5, 3, 10, −2, 1] , resulting in a new\\nvector that is the element-by-element “sum” of the ﬁrst vector and the list in-\\nstance. This is a result of Python’s polymorphism . Literally, “polymorphism”\\nmeans “many forms.” Although it is tempting to think of the other parameter of\\nour\\nadd\\n method as another Vector instance, we never declared it as such.\\nWithin the body, the only behaviors we rely on for parameter other is that it sup-\\nportslen(other) and access to other[j] . Therefore, our code executes when the\\nright-hand operand is a list of numbers (with matching length).'),\n",

Our pre-\\nferred approach is the use of the generator syntax (also described in Section 1.8),\\nwhich automatically produces an iterator of yielded values.\\nPython also helps by providing an automatic iterator implementation for any\\nclass that deﬁnes both\\n len\\n and\\n getitem\\n . To provide an instructive exam-\\nple of a low-level iterator, Code Fragment 2.5 demonstrates just such an iteratorclass that works on any collection that supports both\\nlen\\n and\\n getitem\\n .\\nThis class can be instantiated as SequenceIterator(data) . It operates by keeping an\\ninternal reference to the data sequence, as well as a current index into the sequence.Each time\\nnext\\n is called, the index is incremented, until reaching the end of\\nthe sequence.\\n1classSequenceIterator:\\n2”””An iterator for any of Python\\n s sequence types.”””\\n34def\\ninit\\n(self, sequence):\\n5 ”””Create an iterator for the given sequence.”””\\n6 self.\\nseq = sequence # keep a reference to the underlying data\\n7 self.\\nk=−1 # will increment to 0 on ﬁrst call to next\\n89def\\nnext\\n (self):\\n10 ”””Return the next element, or else raise StopIteration error.”””\\n11 self.\\nk+ =1 # advance to next index\\n12 if self.\\nk<len(self.\\nseq):\\n13 return (self.\\nseq[self.\\nk]) # return the data element\\n14 else:\\n15 raiseStopIteration( ) # there are no more elements\\n1617def\\niter\\n(self):\\n18 ”””By convention, an iterator must return itself as an iterator.”””\\n19 return self\\nCode Fragment 2.5: An iterator class for any sequence type.'),\n",

Object-Oriented Programming\\n2.3.5 Example: Range Class\\nAs the ﬁnal example for this section, we develop our own implementation of a\\nclass that mimics Python’s built-in range class. Before introducing our class, we\\ndiscuss the history of the built-in version. Prior to Python 3 being released, range\\nwas implemented as a function, and it returned a listinstance with elements in\\nthe speciﬁed range. For example, range(2, 10, 2) returned the list [ 2 ,4 ,6 ,8 ] .\\nHowever, a typical use of the function was to support a for-loop syntax, such as\\nforkinrange(10000000) . Unfortunately, this caused the instantiation and initial-\\nization of a list with the range of numbers. That was an unnecessarily expensivestep, in terms of both time and memory usage.\\nThe mechanism used to support ranges in Python 3 is entirely different (to be\\nfair, the “new” behavior existed in Python 2 under the name xrange ). It uses a\\nstrategy known as lazy evaluation . Rather than creating a new list instance, range\\nis a class that can effectively represent the desired range of elements without everstoring them explicitly in memory. To better explore the built-in range class, we\\nrecommend that you create an instance as r = range(8, 140, 5) . The result is a\\nrelatively lightweight object, an instance of the range class, that has only a few\\nbehaviors. The syntax len(r) will report the number of elements that are in the\\ngiven range (27, in our example). A range also supports the\\ngetitem\\n method,\\nso that syntax r[15] reports the sixteenth element in the range (as r[0]is the ﬁrst\\nelement). Because the class supports both\\n len\\n and\\n getitem\\n , it inherits\\nautomatic support for iteration (see Section 2.3.4), which is why it is possible toexecute a for loop over a range.\\nAt this point, we are ready to demonstrate our own version of such a class. Code\\nFragment 2.6 provides a class we name Range (so as to clearly differentiate it from\\nbuilt-in range) . The biggest challenge in the implementation is properly computing\\nthe number of elements that belong in the range, given the parameters sent by the\\ncaller when constructing a range. By computing that value in the constructor, and\\nstoring it as self.\\nlength , it becomes trivial to return it from the\\n len\\n method. To\\nproperly implement a call to\\n getitem\\n (k), we simply take the starting value of\\nthe range plus ktimes the step size (i.e., for k=0, we return the start value). There\\nare a few subtleties worth examining in the code:\\n•To properly support optional parameters, we rely on the technique describedon page 27, when discussing a functional version of range.\\n•We compute the number of elements in the range as\\nmax(0, (stop −start + step −1) // step)\\nIt is worth testing this formula for both positive and negative step sizes.\\n•The\\ngetitem\\n method properly supports negative indices by converting\\nan index −ktolen(self) −kbefore computing the result.'),\n",

Object-Oriented Programming\\n2.4 Inheritance\\nA natural way to organize various structural components of a software package\\nis in a hierarchical fashion, with similar abstract deﬁnitions grouped together in\\na level-by-level manner that goes from speciﬁc to more general as one traversesup the hierarchy. An example of such a hierarchy is shown in Figure 2.4. Using\\nmathematical notations, the set of houses is a subset of the set of buildings, but a\\nsuperset of the set of ranches. The correspondence between levels is often referred\\nto as an “is a” relationship , as a house is a building, and a ranch is a house.\\nBuilding\\nLow-rise\\nApartmentHigh-rise\\nApartmentTwo-story\\nHouseRanch SkyscraperCommercial\\nBuildingHouse Apartment\\nFigure 2.4: An example of an “is a” hierarchy involving architectural buildings.\\nA hierarchical design is useful in software development, as common function-\\nality can be grouped at the most general level, thereby promoting reuse of code,\\nwhile differentiated behaviors can be viewed as extensions of the general case, Inobject-oriented programming, the mechanism for a modular and hierarchical orga-nization is a technique known as inheritance . This allows a new class to be deﬁned\\nbased upon an existing class as the starting point. In object-oriented terminology,the existing class is typically described as the base class ,parent class ,o rsuper-\\nclass , while the newly deﬁned class is known as the subclass orchild class .\\nThere are two ways in which a subclass can differentiate itself from its su-\\nperclass. A subclass may specialize an existing behavior by providing a new im-\\nplementation that overrides an existing method. A subclass may also extend its\\nsuperclass by providing brand new methods.'),\n",

Inheritance 83\\nPython’s Exception Hierarchy\\nAnother example of a rich inheritance hierarchy is the organization of various ex-\\nception types in Python. We introduced many of those classes in Section 1.7, but\\ndid not discuss their relationship with each other. Figure 2.5 illustrates a (small)portion of that hierarchy. The BaseException class is the root of the entire hierar-\\nchy, while the more speciﬁc Exception class includes most of the error types that\\nwe have discussed. Programmers are welcome to deﬁne their own special exceptionclasses to denote errors that may occur in the context of their application.

The new class will differ from the original in two\\nways: (1) if an attempted charge is rejected because it would have exceeded thecredit limit, a $5 fee will be charged, and (2) there will be a mechanism for assess-\\ning a monthly interest charge on the outstanding balance, based upon an Annual\\nPercentage Rate (APR) speciﬁed as a constructor parameter.\\nIn accomplishing this goal, we demonstrate the techniques of specialization\\nand extension. To charge a fee for an invalid charge attempt, we override the\\nexisting charge method, thereby specializing it to provide the new functionality\\n(although the new version takes advantage of a call to the overridden version). Toprovide support for charging interest, we extend the class with a new method named\\nprocess\\nmonth .'),\n",

Object-Oriented Programming\\nthe charge was successful. We examine that return value to decide whether to as-\\nsess a fee, and in turn we return that value to the caller of method, so that the new\\nversion of charge has a similar outward interface as the original.\\nTheprocess\\n month method is a new behavior, so there is no inherited version\\nupon which to rely. In our model, this method should be invoked by the bank,once each month, to add new interest charges to the customer’s balance. The mostchallenging aspect in implementing this method is making sure we have working\\nknowledge of how an annual percentage rate translates to a monthly rate. We do\\nnot simply divide the annual rate by twelve to get a monthly rate (that would be toopredatory, as it would result in a higher APR than advertised). The correct com-putation is to take the twelfth-root of 1+s e l f .\\napr, and use that as a multiplica-\\ntive factor. For example, if the APR is 0.0825 (representing 8.25%), we compute\\n12√\\n1.0825≈1.006628, and therefore charge 0 .6628% interest per month. In this\\nway, each $100 of debt will amass $8.25 of compounded interest in a year.\\nProtected Members\\nOurPredatoryCreditCard subclass directly accesses the data member self.\\nbalance ,\\nwhich was established by the parent CreditCard class. The underscored name, by\\nconvention, suggests that this is a nonpublic member, so we might ask if it is okay\\nthat we access it in this fashion. While general users of the class should not bedoing so, our subclass has a somewhat privileged relationship with the superclass.\\nSeveral object-oriented languages (e.g., Java, C++) draw a distinction for nonpub-\\nlic members, allowing declarations of protected orprivate access modes. Members\\nthat are declared as protected are accessible to subclasses, but not to the generalpublic, while members that are declared as private are not accessible to either. In\\nthis respect, we are using\\nbalance as if it were protected (but not private).\\nPython does not support formal access control, but names beginning with a sin-\\ngle underscore are conventionally akin to protected, while names beginning with a\\ndouble underscore (other than special methods) are akin to private. In choosing touse protected data, we have created a dependency in that our PredatoryCreditCard\\nclass might be compromised if the author of the CreditCard class were to change\\nthe internal design. Note that we could have relied upon the public get\\nbalance()\\nmethod to retrieve the current balance within the process\\n month method. But the\\ncurrent design of the CreditCard class does not afford an effective way for a sub-\\nclass to change the balance, other than by direct manipulation of the data member.\\nIt may be tempting to use charge to add fees or interest to the balance. However,\\nthat method does not allow the balance to go above the customer’s credit limit,\\neven though a bank would presumably let interest compound beyond the creditlimit, if warranted. If we were to redesign the original CreditCard class, we might\\nadd a nonpublic method,\\nset\\nbalance , that could be used by subclasses to affect a\\nchange without directly accessing the data member\\n balance .'),\n",

Inheritance 87\\n2.4.2 Hierarchy of Numeric Progressions\\nAs a second example of the use of inheritance, we develop a hierarchy of classes for\\niterating numeric progressions. A numeric progression is a sequence of numbers,where each number depends on one or more of the previous numbers. For example,anarithmetic progression determines the next number by adding a ﬁxed constant\\nto the previous value, and a geometric progression determines the next number\\nby multiplying the previous value by a ﬁxed constant. In general, a progressionrequires a ﬁrst value, and a way of identifying a new value based on one or moreprevious values.\\nTo maximize reusability of code, we develop a hierarchy of classes stemming\\nfrom a general base class that we name Progression (see Figure 2.7). Technically,\\ntheProgression class produces the progression of whole numbers: 0, 1, 2, . . . .\\nHowever, this class is designed to serve as the base class for other progression types,providing as much common functionality as possible, and thereby minimizing the\\nburden on the subclasses.\\nFibonacciProgressionProgression\\nArithmeticProgression GeometricProgression\\nFigure 2.7: Our hierarchy of progression classes.\\nOur implementation of the basic Progression class is provided in Code Frag-\\nment 2.8. The constructor for this class accepts a starting value for the progression\\n(0 by default), and initializes a data member, self.\\ncurrent , to that value.\\nTheProgression class implements the conventions of a Python iterator (see\\nSection 2.3.4), namely the special\\n next\\n and\\n iter\\n methods. If a user of\\nthe class creates a progression as seq = Progression() , each call to next(seq) will\\nreturn a subsequent element of the progression sequence. It would also be possi-ble to use a for-loop syntax, forvalueinseq:, although we note that our default\\nprogression is deﬁned as an inﬁnite sequence.\\nTo better separate the mechanics of the iterator convention from the core logic\\nof advancing the progression, our framework relies on a nonpublic method named\\nadvance to update the value of the self.\\ncurrent ﬁeld. In the default implementa-\\ntion,\\n advance adds one to the current value, but our intent is that subclasses will\\noverride\\n advance to provide a different rule for computing the next entry.\\nFor convenience, the Progression class also provides a utility method, named\\nprint\\nprogression , that displays the next nvalues of the progression.'),\n",

Inheritance 93\\n2.4.3 Abstract Base Classes\\nWhen deﬁning a group of classes as part of an inheritance hierarchy, one technique\\nfor avoiding repetition of code is to design a base class with common function-ality that can be inherited by other classes that need it. As an example, the hi-erarchy from Section 2.4.2 includes a Progression class, which serves as a base\\nclass for three distinct subclasses: ArithmeticProgression ,GeometricProgression ,\\nandFibonacciProgression . Although it is possible to create an instance of the\\nProgression base class, there is little value in doing so because its behavior is sim-\\nply a special case of an ArithmeticProgression with increment 1. The real purpose\\nof the Progression class was to centralize the implementations of behaviors that\\nother progressions needed, thereby streamlining the code that is relegated to thosesubclasses.\\nIn classic object-oriented terminology, we say a class is an abstract base class\\nif its only purpose is to serve as a base class through inheritance. More formally,\\nan abstract base class is one that cannot be directly instantiated, while a concrete\\nclass is one that can be instantiated. By this deﬁnition, our Progression class is\\ntechnically concrete, although we essentially designed it as an abstract base class.\\nIn statically typed languages such as Java and C++, an abstract base class serves\\nas a formal type that may guarantee one or more abstract methods . This provides\\nsupport for polymorphism, as a variable may have an abstract base class as its de-\\nclared type, even though it refers to an instance of a concrete subclass. Becausethere are no declared types in Python, this kind of polymorphism can be accom-\\nplished without the need for a unifying abstract base class. For this reason, there\\nis not as strong a tradition of deﬁning abstract base classes in Python, althoughPython’s abcmodule provides support for deﬁning a formal abstract base class.\\nOur reason for focusing on abstract base classes in our study of data structures\\nis that Python’s collections module provides several abstract base classes that assist\\nwhen deﬁning custom data structures that share a common interface with some ofPython’s built-in data structures. These rely on an object-oriented software designpattern known as the template method pattern . The template method pattern is\\nwhen an abstract base class provides concrete behaviors that rely upon calls toother abstract behaviors. In that way, as soon as a subclass provides deﬁnitions forthe missing abstract behaviors, the inherited concrete behaviors are well deﬁned.\\nAs a tangible example, the collections.Sequence abstract base class deﬁnes be-\\nhaviors common to Python’s list,str,a n d tuple classes, as sequences that sup-\\nport element access via an integer index. More so, the collections.Sequence class\\nprovides concrete implementations of methods, count ,index ,a n d\\ncontains\\nthat can be inherited by any class that provides concrete implementations of both\\nlen\\n and\\n getitem\\n . For the purpose of illustration, we provide a sample\\nimplementation of such a Sequence abstract base class in Code Fragment 2.14.'),\n",

The ﬁrst is that\\nwe declare the ABCMeta class of the abcmodule as a metaclass of our Sequence\\nclass.

Speciﬁcally, the ABCMeta declaration assures that the\\nconstructor for the class raises an error.'),\n",

Inheritance 95\\nThe second advanced technique is the use of the @abstractmethod decorator\\nimmediately before the\\n len\\n and\\n getitem\\n methods are declared. That de-\\nclares these two particular methods to be abstract, meaning that we do not provide\\nan implementation within our Sequence base class, but that we expect any concrete\\nsubclasses to support those two methods. Python enforces this expectation, by dis-allowing instantiation for any subclass that does not override the abstract methods\\nwith concrete implementations.\\nThe rest of the Sequence class deﬁnition provides tangible implementations for\\nother behaviors, under the assumption that the abstract\\nlen\\n and\\n getitem\\nmethods will exist in a concrete subclass. If you carefully examine the source code,\\nthe implementations of methods\\n contains\\n ,index ,a n dcount do not rely on any\\nassumption about the selfinstances, other than that syntax len(self) andself[j] are\\nsupported (by special methods\\n len\\n and\\n getitem\\n , respectively). Support\\nfor iteration is automatic as well, as described in Section 2.3.4.\\nIn the remainder of this book, we omit the formality of using the abcmodule.\\nIf we need an “abstract” base class, we simply document the expectation that sub-\\nclasses provide assumed functionality, without technical declaration of the methods\\nas abstract. But we will make use of the wonderful abstract base classes that aredeﬁned within the collections module (such as Sequence ). To use such a class, we\\nneed only rely on standard inheritance techniques.\\nFor example, our Range class, from Code Fragment 2.6 of Section 2.3.5, is an\\nexample of a class that supports the\\nlen\\n and\\n getitem\\n methods. But that\\nclass does not support methods count orindex . Had we originally declared it with\\nSequence as a superclass, then it would also inherit the count andindex methods.\\nThe syntax for such a declaration would begin as:\\nclassRange(collections.Sequence):\\nFinally, we emphasize that if a subclass provides its own implementation of\\nan inherited behaviors from a base class, the new deﬁnition overrides the inherited\\none. This technique can be used when we have the ability to provide a more efﬁ-\\ncient implementation for a behavior than is achieved by the generic approach. As\\nan example, the general implementation of\\n contains\\n for a sequence is based\\non a loop used to search for the desired value. For our Range class, there is an\\nopportunity for a more efﬁcient determination of containment. For example, it\\nis evident that the expression, 100000 inRange(0, 2000000, 100) , should evalu-\\nate toTrue , even without examining the individual elements of the range, because\\nthe range starts with zero, has an increment of 100, and goes until 2 million; it\\nmust include 100000, as that is a multiple of 100 that is between the start andstop values. Exercise C-2.27 explores the goal of providing an implementation of\\nRange.\\ncontains\\n that avoids the use of a (time-consuming) loop.'),\n",

Object-Oriented Programming\\n2.5 Namespaces and Object-Orientation\\nAnamespace is an abstraction that manages all of the identiﬁers that are deﬁned in\\na particular scope, mapping each name to its associated value. In Python, functions,\\nclasses, and modules are all ﬁrst-class objects, and so the “value” associated with\\nan identiﬁer in a namespace may in fact be a function, class, or module.\\nIn Section 1.10 we explored Python’s use of namespaces to manage identiﬁers\\nthat are deﬁned with global scope, versus those deﬁned within the local scope of\\na function call. In this section, we discuss the important role of namespaces inPython’s management of object-orientation.\\n2.5.1 Instance and Class Namespaces\\nWe begin by exploring what is known as the instance namespace , which man-\\nages attributes speciﬁc to an individual object. For example, each instance of our\\nCreditCard class maintains a distinct balance, a distinct account number, a distinct\\ncredit limit, and so on (even though some instances may coincidentally have equiv-\\nalent balances, or equivalent credit limits). Each credit card will have a dedicatedinstance namespace to manage such values.\\nThere is a separate class namespace for each class that has been deﬁned. This\\nnamespace is used to manage members that are to be shared by all instances of\\na class, or used without reference to any particular instance. For example, themake\\npayment method of the CreditCard class from Section 2.3 is not stored\\nindependently by each instance of that class. That member function is stored\\nwithin the namespace of the CreditCard class. Based on our deﬁnition from Code\\nFragments 2.1 and 2.2, the CreditCard class namespace includes the functions:\\ninit\\n ,get\\ncustomer ,get\\nbank ,get\\naccount ,get\\nbalance ,get\\nlimit,charge ,\\nandmake\\n payment .O u rPredatoryCreditCard class has its own namespace, con-\\ntaining the three methods we deﬁned for that subclass:\\n init\\n ,charge ,a n d\\nprocess\\n month .\\nFigure 2.8 provides a portrayal of three such namespaces: a class namespace\\ncontaining methods of the CreditCard class, another class namespace with meth-\\nods of the PredatoryCreditCard class, and ﬁnally a single instance namespace for\\na sample instance of the PredatoryCreditCard class. We note that there are two\\ndifferent deﬁnitions of a function named charge , one in the CreditCard class, and\\nthen the overriding method in the PredatoryCreditCard class. In similar fashion,\\nthere are two distinct\\n init\\n implementations. However, process\\n month is a\\nname that is only deﬁned within the scope of the PredatoryCreditCard class. The\\ninstance namespace includes all data members for the instance (including the\\n apr\\nmember that is established by the PredatoryCreditCard constructor).'),\n",

The balance is established within the\\n init\\n method when a\\nnew credit card instance is constructed. The original assignment uses the syntax,\\nself.\\nbalance = 0 ,w h e r e selfis an identiﬁer for the newly constructed instance.\\nThe use of selfas a qualiﬁer for self.\\nbalance in such an assignment causes the\\nbalance identiﬁer to be added directly to the instance namespace.\\nWhen inheritance is used, there is still a single instance namespace per object.\\nFor example, when an instance of the PredatoryCreditCard class is constructed,\\nthe\\naprattribute as well as attributes such as\\n balance and\\nlimit all reside in that\\ninstance’s namespace, because all are assigned using a qualiﬁed syntax, such as\\nself.\\napr.\\nAclass namespace includes all declarations that are made directly within the\\nbody of the class deﬁnition. For example, our CreditCard class deﬁnition included\\nthe following structure:\\nclassCreditCard:\\ndefmake\\n payment( self, amount):\\n...\\nBecause the make\\n payment function is declared within the scope of the CreditCard\\nclass, that function becomes associated with the name make\\n payment within the\\nCreditCard class namespace. Although member functions are the most typical\\ntypes of entries that are declared in a class namespace, we next discuss how othertypes of data values, or even other classes can be declared within a class namespace.'),\n",

Object-Oriented Programming\\nClass Data Members\\nA class-level data member is often used when there is some value, such as a con-\\nstant, that is to be shared by all instances of a class. In such a case, it would\\nbe unnecessarily wasteful to have each instance store that value in its instance\\nnamespace. As an example, we revisit the PredatoryCreditCard introduced in Sec-\\ntion 2.4.1. That class assesses a $5 fee if an attempted charge is denied becauseof the credit limit. Our choice of $5 for the fee was somewhat arbitrary, and ourcoding style would be better if we used a named variable rather than embedding\\nthe literal value in our code. Often, the amount of such a fee is determined by the\\nbank’s policy and does not vary for each customer. In that case, we could deﬁneand use a class data member as follows:\\nclassPredatoryCreditCard(CreditCard):\\nOVERLIMIT\\nFEE = 5 #t h i si sac l a s s - l e v e lm e m b e r\\ndefcharge( self,p r i c e ) :\\nsuccess = super().charge(price)\\nif not success:\\nself.\\nbalance += PredatoryCreditCard.OVERLIMIT\\n FEE\\nreturn success\\nThe data member, OVERLIMIT\\n FEE, is entered into the PredatoryCreditCard\\nclass namespace because that assignment takes place within the immediate scope\\nof the class deﬁnition, and without any qualifying identiﬁer.\\nNested Classes\\nIt is also possible to nest one class deﬁnition within the scope of another class.\\nThis is a useful construct, which we will exploit several times in this book in theimplementation of data structures. This can be done by using a syntax such as\\nclassA: #t h eo u t e rc l a s s\\nclassB: # the nested class\\n...\\nIn this case, class Bis the nested class. The identiﬁer Bis entered into the name-\\nspace of class Aassociated with the newly deﬁned class. We note that this technique\\nis unrelated to the concept of inheritance, as class Bdoes not inherit from class A.\\nNesting one class in the scope of another makes clear that the nested class\\nexists for support of the outer class. Furthermore, it can help reduce potential name\\nconﬂicts, because it allows for a similarly named class to exist in another context.For example, we will later introduce a data structure known as a linked list and will\\ndeﬁne a nested node class to store the individual components of the list. We will\\nalso introduce a data structure known as a treethat depends upon its own nested'),\n",

Namespaces and Object-Orientation 99\\nnode class. These two structures rely on different node deﬁnitions, and by nesting\\nthose within the respective container classes, we avoid ambiguity.\\nAnother advantage of one class being nested as a member of another is that it\\nallows for a more advanced form of inheritance in which a subclass of the outer\\nclass overrides the deﬁnition of its nested class. We will make use of that techniquein Section 11.2.1 when specializing the nodes of a tree structure.\\nDictionaries and the\\n slots\\n Declaration\\nBy default, Python represents each namespace with an instance of the built-in dict\\nclass (see Section 1.2.3) that maps identifying names in that scope to the associatedobjects. While a dictionary structure supports relatively efﬁcient name lookups,it requires additional memory usage beyond the raw data that it stores (we willexplore the data structure used to implement dictionaries in Chapter 10).\\nPython provides a more direct mechanism for representing instance namespaces\\nthat avoids the use of an auxiliary dictionary. To use the streamlined representation\\nfor all instances of a class, that class deﬁnition must provide a class-level member\\nnamed\\nslots\\n that is assigned to a ﬁxed sequence of strings that serve as names\\nfor instance variables. For example, with our CreditCard class, we would declare\\nthe following:\\nclassCreditCard:\\nslots\\n =\\n_customer\\n ,\\n_bank\\n ,\\n_account\\n ,\\n_balance\\n ,\\n_limit\\nIn this example, the right-hand side of the assignment is technically a tuple (see\\ndiscussion of automatic packing of tuples in Section 1.9.3).\\nWhen inheritance is used, if the base class declares\\n slots\\n , a subclass must\\nalso declare\\n slots\\n to avoid creation of instance dictionaries. The declaration\\nin the subclass should only include names of supplemental methods that are newly\\nintroduced. For example, our PredatoryCreditCard declaration would include the\\nfollowing declaration:\\nclassPredatoryCreditCard(CreditCard):\\nslots\\n =\\n_apr\\n # in addition to the inherited members\\nWe could choose to use the\\n slots\\n declaration to streamline every class in\\nthis book. However, we do not do so because such rigor would be atypical for\\nPython programs. With that said, there are a few classes in this book for which\\nwe expect to have a large number of instances, each representing a lightweightconstruct. For example, when discussing nested classes, we suggest linked listsand trees as data structures that are often comprised of a large number of individualnodes. To promote greater efﬁciency in memory usage, we will use an explicit\\nslots\\n declaration in any nested classes for which we expect many instances.'),\n",

Object-Oriented Programming\\n2.5.2 Name Resolution and Dynamic Dispatch\\nIn the previous section, we discussed various namespaces, and the mechanism for\\nestablishing entries in those namespaces. In this section, we examine the processthat is used when retrieving a name in Python’s object-oriented framework. When\\nthe dot operator syntax is used to access an existing member, such as obj.foo ,t h e\\nPython interpreter begins a name resolution process, described as follows:\\n1. The instance namespace is searched; if the desired name is found, its associ-\\nated value is used.\\n2. Otherwise the class namespace, for the class to which the instance belongs,\\nis searched; if the name is found, its associated value is used.\\n3. If the name was not found in the immediate class namespace, the search con-\\ntinues upward through the inheritance hierarchy, checking the class name-space for each ancestor (commonly by checking the superclass class, then its\\nsuperclass class, and so on). The ﬁrst time the name is found, its associate\\nvalue is used.\\n4. If the name has still not been found, an AttributeError is raised.\\nAs a tangible example, let us assume that mycard identiﬁes an instance of the\\nPredatoryCreditCard class. Consider the following possible usage patterns.\\n•mycard.\\nbalance (or equivalently, self.\\nbalance from within a method body):\\nthe\\nbalance method is found within the instance namespace formycard .\\n•mycard.process\\n month() : the search begins in the instance namespace, but\\nthe name process\\n month is not found in that namespace. As a result, the\\nPredatoryCreditCard class namespace is searched; in this case, the name is\\nfound and that method is called.\\n•mycard.make\\n payment(200) : the search for the name, make\\n payment , fails\\nin the instance namespace and in the PredatoryCreditCard namespace. The\\nname is resolved in the namespace for superclass CreditCard and thus the\\ninherited method is called.\\n•mycard.charge(50) : the search for name charge fails in the instance name-\\nspace. The next namespace checked is for the PredatoryCreditCard class,\\nbecause that is the true type of the instance. There is a deﬁnition for a charge\\nfunction in that class, and so that is the one that is called.\\nIn the last case shown, notice that the existence of a charge function in the\\nPredatoryCreditCard class has the effect of overriding the version of that function\\nthat exists in the CreditCard namespace. In traditional object-oriented terminol-\\nogy, Python uses what is known as dynamic dispatch (ordynamic binding )t o\\ndetermine, at run-time, which implementation of a function to call based upon thetype of the object upon which it is invoked. This is in contrast to some languagesthat use static dispatching , making a compile-time decision as to which version of\\na function to call, based upon the declared type of a variable.'),\n",

In this section, we consider\\nthe task of making a copy of an object, rather than an alias. This is necessary in\\napplications when we want to subsequently modify either the original or the copy\\nin an independent manner.\\nConsider a scenario in which we manage various lists of colors, with each color\\nrepresented by an instance of a presumed color class. We let identiﬁer warmtones\\ndenote an existing list of such colors (e.g., oranges, browns). In this application,we wish to create a new list named palette , which is a copy of the warmtones list.\\nHowever, we want to subsequently be able to add additional colors to palette ,o r\\nto modify or remove some of the existing colors, without affecting the contents ofwarmtones . If we were to execute the command\\npalette = warmtones\\nthis creates an alias, as shown in Figure 2.9. No new list is created; instead, the\\nnew identiﬁer palette references the original list.\\nred\\ngreen\\nbluecolor\\n52163169listwarmtones\\nred\\ngreen\\nbluecolor\\n43124249palette\\nFigure 2.9: Two aliases for the same list of colors.\\nUnfortunately, this does not meet our desired criteria, because if we subsequently\\nadd or remove colors from “palette,” we modify the list identiﬁed as warmtones .\\nWe can instead create a new instance of the listclass by using the syntax:\\npalette = list(warmtones)\\nIn this case, we explicitly call the listconstructor, sending the ﬁrst list as a param-\\neter. This causes a new list to be created, as shown in Figure 2.10; however, it iswhat is known as a shallow copy . The new list is initialized so that its contents are\\nprecisely the same as the original sequence. However, Python’s lists are referential\\n(see page 9 of Section 1.2.3), and so the new list represents a sequence of references\\nto the same elements as in the ﬁrst.'),\n",

Algorithm Analysis\\nIn a classic story, the famous mathematician Archimedes was asked to deter-\\nmine if a golden crown commissioned by the king was indeed pure gold, and not\\npart silver, as an informant had claimed. Archimedes discovered a way to performthis analysis while stepping into a bath. He noted that water spilled out of the bathin proportion to the amount of him that went in. Realizing the implications of thisfact, he immediately got out of the bath and ran naked through the city shouting,\\n“Eureka, eureka!” for he had discovered an analysis tool (displacement), which,\\nwhen combined with a simple scale, could determine if the king’s new crown wasgood or not. That is, Archimedes could dip the crown and an equal-weight amountof gold into a bowl of water to see if they both displaced the same amount. This\\ndiscovery was unfortunate for the goldsmith, however, for when Archimedes did\\nhis analysis, the crown displaced more water than an equal-weight lump of puregold, indicating that the crown was not, in fact, pure gold.\\nIn this book, we are interested in the design of “good” data structures and algo-\\nrithms. Simply put, a data structure is a systematic way of organizing and access-\\ning data, and an algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for performing some task in\\na ﬁnite amount of time. These concepts are central to computing, but to be able toclassify some data structures and algorithms as “good,” we must have precise waysof analyzing them.\\nThe primary analysis tool we will use in this book involves characterizing the\\nrunning times of algorithms and data structure operations, with space usage also\\nbeing of interest. Running time is a natural measure of “goodness,” since time is a\\nprecious resource—computer solutions should run as fast as possible. In general,the running time of an algorithm or data structure operation increases with the inputsize, although it may also vary for different inputs of the same size. Also, the run-\\nning time is affected by the hardware environment (e.g., the processor, clock rate,\\nmemory, disk) and software environment (e.g., the operating system, programminglanguage) in which the algorithm is implemented and executed. All other factorsbeing equal, the running time of the same algorithm on the same input data will besmaller if the computer has, say, a much faster processor or if the implementation\\nis done in a program compiled into native machine code instead of an interpreted\\nimplementation. We begin this chapter by discussing tools for performing exper-imental studies, yet also limitations to the use of experiments as a primary meansfor evaluating algorithm efﬁciency.\\nFocusing on running time as a primary measure of goodness requires that we be\\nable to use a few mathematical tools. In spite of the possible variations that comefrom different environmental factors, we would like to focus on the relationshipbetween the running time of an algorithm and the size of its input. We are interestedin characterizing an algorithm’s running time as a function of the input size. Butwhat is the proper way of measuring it? In this chapter, we “roll up our sleeves”\\nand develop a mathematical way of analyzing algorithms.'),\n",

Experimental Studies 111\\n3.1 Experimental Studies\\nIf an algorithm has been implemented, we can study its running time by executing\\nit on various test inputs and recording the time spent during each execution. Asimple approach for doing this in Python is by using the time function of the time\\nmodule. This function reports the number of seconds, or fractions thereof, that haveelapsed since a benchmark time known as the epoch. The choice of the epoch isnot signiﬁcant to our goal, as we can determine the elapsed time by recording the\\ntime just before the algorithm and the time just after the algorithm, and computing\\ntheir difference, as follows:\\nfromtimeimport time\\nstart\\ntime = time( ) # record the starting time\\nrun algorithmend\\ntime = time( ) # record the ending time\\nelapsed = end\\n time−start\\ntime # compute the elapsed time\\nWe will demonstrate use of this approach, in Chapter 5, to gather experimental dataon the efﬁciency of Python’s listclass. An elapsed time measured in this fashion\\nis a decent reﬂection of the algorithm efﬁciency, but it is by no means perfect. The\\ntime function measures relative to what is known as the “wall clock.” Because\\nmany processes share use of a computer’s central processing unit (orCPU ), the\\nelapsed time will depend on what other processes are running on the computer\\nwhen the test is performed. A fairer metric is the number of CPU cycles that are\\nused by the algorithm. This can be determined using the clock function of the time\\nmodule, but even this measure might not be consistent if repeating the identicalalgorithm on the identical input, and its granularity will depend upon the computer\\nsystem. Python includes a more advanced module, named timeit ,t oh e l pa u t o m a t e\\nsuch evaluations with repetition to account for such variance among trials.\\nBecause we are interested in the general dependence of running time on the size\\nand structure of the input, we should perform independent experiments on many\\ndifferent test inputs of various sizes. We can then visualize the results by plottingthe performance of each run of the algorithm as a point with x-coordinate equal to\\nthe input size, n,a n d y-coordinate equal to the running time, t. Figure 3.1 displays\\nsuch hypothetical data. This visualization may provide some intuition regardingthe relationship between problem size and execution time for the algorithm. Thismay lead to a statistical analysis that seeks to ﬁt the best function of the input sizeto the experimental data. To be meaningful, this analysis requires that we choosegood sample inputs and test enough of them to be able to make sound statistical\\nclaims about the algorithm’s running time.'),\n",

Is performed by studying a high-level description of the algorithm without\\nneed for implementation.\\n3. Takes into account all possible inputs.\\nCounting Primitive Operations\\nTo analyze the running time of an algorithm without performing experiments, we\\nperform an analysis directly on a high-level description of the algorithm (either in\\nthe form of an actual code fragment, or language-independent pseudo-code). Wedeﬁne a set of primitive operations such as the following:\\n•Assigning an identiﬁer to an object\\n•Determining the object associated with an identiﬁer\\n•Performing an arithmetic operation (for example, adding two numbers)\\n•Comparing two numbers\\n•Accessing a single element of a Python listby index\\n•Calling a function (excluding operations executed within the function)\\n•Returning from a function.\\nFormally, a primitive operation corresponds to a low-level instruction with an exe-cution time that is constant. Ideally, this might be the type of basic operation that isexecuted by the hardware, although many of our primitive operations may be trans-\\nlated to a small number of instructions. Instead of trying to determine the speciﬁc\\nexecution time of each primitive operation, we will simply count how many prim-itive operations are executed, and use this number tas a measure of the running\\ntime of the algorithm.\\nThis operation count will correlate to an actual running time in a speciﬁc com-\\nputer, for each primitive operation corresponds to a constant number of instructions,and there are only a ﬁxed number of primitive operations. The implicit assumptionin this approach is that the running times of different primitive operations will befairly similar. Thus, the number, t, of primitive operations an algorithm performs\\nwill be proportional to the actual running time of that algorithm.\\nMeasuring Operations as a Function of Input Size\\nTo capture the order of growth of an algorithm’s running time, we will associate,with each algorithm, a function f(n)that characterizes the number of primitive\\noperations that are performed as a function of the input size n.

Unfortunately, such an average-case analysis is typically quite challenging.\\nIt requires us to deﬁne a probability distribution on the set of inputs, which is oftena difﬁcult task. Figure 3.2 schematically shows how, depending on the input distri-bution, the running time of an algorithm can be anywhere between the worst-case\\ntime and the best-case time. For example, what if inputs are really only of types\\n“A” or “D”?\\nAn average-case analysis usually requires that we calculate expected running\\ntimes based on a given input distribution, which usually involves sophisticated\\nprobability theory. Therefore, for the remainder of this book, unless we specify\\notherwise, we will characterize running times in terms of the worst case ,a saf u n c -\\ntion of the input size, n, of the algorithm.\\nWorst-case analysis is much easier than average-case analysis, as it requires\\nonly the ability to identify the worst-case input, which is often simple.

The Seven Functions Used in This Book 115\\n3.2 The Seven Functions Used in This Book\\nIn this section, we brieﬂy discuss the seven most important functions used in the\\nanalysis of algorithms. We will use only these seven simple functions for almostall the analysis we do in this book. In fact, a section that uses a function other\\nthan one of these seven will be marked with a star ( ⋆) to indicate that it is optional.\\nIn addition to these seven fundamental functions, Appendix B contains a list of\\nother useful mathematical facts that apply in the analysis of data structures andalgorithms.\\nThe Constant Function\\nThe simplest function we can think of is the constant function . This is the function,\\nf(n)=c,\\nfor some ﬁxed constant c,s u c ha s c=5,c=27, or c=210. T h a ti s ,f o ra n y\\nargument n, the constant function f(n)assigns the value c. In other words, it does\\nnot matter what the value of nis;f(n)will always be equal to the constant value c.\\nBecause we are most interested in integer functions, the most fundamental con-\\nstant function is g(n)=1, and this is the typical constant function we use in this\\nbook. Note that any other constant function, f(n)=c, can be written as a constant\\nctimes g(n).T h a ti s , f(n)=cg(n)in this case.\\nAs simple as it is, the constant function is useful in algorithm analysis, because\\nit characterizes the number of steps needed to do a basic operation on a computer,like adding two numbers, assigning a value to some variable, or comparing twonumbers.\\nThe Logarithm Function\\nOne of the interesting and sometimes even surprising aspects of the analysis ofdata structures and algorithms is the ubiquitous presence of the logarithm function ,\\nf(n)=log\\nbn, for some constant b>1. This function is deﬁned as follows:\\nx=logbnif and only if bx=n.\\nBy deﬁnition, logb1=0. The value bis known as the base of the logarithm.\\nThe most common base for the logarithm function in computer science is 2,\\nas computers store integers in binary, and because a common operation in manyalgorithms is to repeatedly divide an input in half. In fact, this base is so common\\nthat we will typically omit it from the notation when it is 2. That is, for us,\\nlogn=log\\n2n.'),\n",

The Seven Functions Used in This Book 117\\nThe Linear Function\\nAnother simple yet important function is the linear function ,\\nf(n)=n.\\nThat is, given an input value n, the linear function fassigns the value nitself.\\nThis function arises in algorithm analysis any time we have to do a single basic\\noperation for each of nelements. For example, comparing a number xto each\\nelement of a sequence of size nwill require ncomparisons. The linear function\\nalso represents the best running time we can hope to achieve for any algorithm that\\nprocesses each of nobjects that are not already in the computer’s memory, because\\nreading in the nobjects already requires noperations.\\nThe N-Log- NFunction\\nThe next function we discuss in this section is the n-log-n function ,\\nf(n)=nlogn,\\nthat is, the function that assigns to an input nthe value of ntimes the logarithm\\nbase-two of n. This function grows a little more rapidly than the linear function and\\na lot less rapidly than the quadratic function; therefore, we would greatly prefer analgorithm with a running time that is proportional to nlogn, than one with quadratic\\nrunning time. We will see several important algorithms that exhibit a running time\\nproportional to the n-log- nfunction. For example, the fastest possible algorithms\\nfor sorting narbitrary values require time proportional to nlogn.\\nThe Quadratic Function\\nAnother function that appears often in algorithm analysis is the quadratic function ,\\nf(n)=n2.\\nThat is, given an input value n, the function fassigns the product of nwith itself\\n(in other words, “ nsquared”).\\nThe main reason why the quadratic function appears in the analysis of algo-\\nrithms is that there are many algorithms that have nested loops, where the inner\\nloop performs a linear number of operations and the outer loop is performed alinear number of times. Thus, in such cases, the algorithm performs n·n=n\\n2\\noperations.'),\n",

Algorithm Analysis\\nNested Loops and the Quadratic Function\\nThe quadratic function can also arise in the context of nested loops where the ﬁrst\\niteration of a loop uses one operation, the second uses two operations, the third usesthree operations, and so on.

The Seven Functions Used in This Book 119\\nThe lesson to be learned from Proposition 3.3 is that if we perform an algorithm\\nwith nested loops such that the operations in the inner loop increase by one each\\ntime, then the total number of operations is quadratic in the number of times, n,\\nwe perform the outer loop. To be fair, the number of operations is n2/2+n/2,\\nand so this is just over half the number of operations than an algorithm that uses n\\noperations each time the inner loop is performed. But the order of growth is still\\nquadratic in n.\\nThe Cubic Function and Other Polynomials\\nContinuing our discussion of functions that are powers of the input, we consider\\nthecubic function ,\\nf(n)=n3,\\nwhich assigns to an input value nthe product of nwith itself three times. This func-\\ntion appears less frequently in the context of algorithm analysis than the constant,linear, and quadratic functions previously mentioned, but it does appear from timeto time.\\nPolynomials\\nMost of the functions we have listed so far can each be viewed as being part of a\\nlarger class of functions, the polynomials .Apolynomial function has the form,\\nf(n)=a0+a1n+a2n2+a3n3+···+adnd,\\nwhere a0,a1,..., adare constants, called the coefﬁcients of the polynomial, and\\nad̸=0. Integer d, which indicates the highest power in the polynomial, is called\\nthedegree of the polynomial.\\nFor example, the following functions are all polynomials:\\n•f(n)=2+5n+n2\\n•f(n)=1+n3\\n•f(n)=1\\n•f(n)=n\\n•f(n)=n2\\nTherefore, we could argue that this book presents just four important functions used\\nin algorithm analysis, but we will stick to saying that there are seven, since the con-stant, linear, and quadratic functions are too important to be lumped in with otherpolynomials. Running times that are polynomials with small degree are generally\\nbetter than polynomial running times with larger degree.'),\n",

Asymptotic Analysis 123\\n3.3 Asymptotic Analysis\\nIn algorithm analysis, we focus on the growth rate of the running time as a function\\nof the input size n, taking a “big-picture” approach. For example, it is often enough\\njust to know that the running time of an algorithm grows proportionally to n.\\nWe analyze algorithms using a mathematical notation for functions that disre-\\ngards constant factors. Namely, we characterize the running times of algorithmsby using functions that map the size of the input, n, to values that correspond to\\nthe main factor that determines the growth rate in terms of n. This approach re-\\nﬂects that each basic step in a pseudo-code description or a high-level languageimplementation may correspond to a small number of primitive operations. Thus,we can perform an analysis of an algorithm by estimating the number of primitiveoperations executed up to a constant factor, rather than getting bogged down inlanguage-speciﬁc or hardware-speciﬁc analysis of the exact number of operations\\nthat execute on the computer.\\nAs a tangible example, we revisit the goal of ﬁnding the largest element of a\\nPython list; we ﬁrst used this example when introducing for loops on page 21 of\\nSection 1.4.2. Code Fragment 3.1 presents a function named ﬁnd\\nmax for this task.\\n1defﬁnd\\nmax(data):\\n2”””Return the maximum element from a nonempty Python list.”””\\n3biggest = data[0] # The initial value to beat\\n4forvalindata: # For each value:\\n5 ifval>biggest # if it is greater than the best so far,\\n6 biggest = val # we have found a new best (so far)\\n7return biggest # When loop ends, biggest is the max\\nCode Fragment 3.1: A function that returns the maximum value of a Python list.\\nThis is a classic example of an algorithm with a running time that grows pro-\\nportional to n, as the loop executes once for each data element, with some ﬁxed\\nnumber of primitive operations executing for each pass. In the remainder of thissection, we provide a framework to formalize this claim.\\n3.3.1 The “Big-Oh” Notation\\nLetf(n)andg(n)be functions mapping positive integers to positive real numbers.\\nWe say that f(n)isO(g(n))if there is a real constant c>0 and an integer constant\\nn0≥1 such that\\nf(n)≤cg(n),for n≥n0.\\nThis deﬁnition is often referred to as the “big-Oh” notation, for it is sometimes pro-\\nnounced as “ f(n)isbig-Oh ofg(n).” Figure 3.5 illustrates the general deﬁnition.'),\n",

For example,\\nwe could rely on constants c=13 and n0=1.\\nThe big-Oh notation allows us to say that a function f(n)is “less than or equal\\nto” another function g(n)up to a constant factor and in the asymptotic sense as n\\ngrows toward inﬁnity. This ability comes from the fact that the deﬁnition uses “ ≤”\\nto compare f(n)to ag(n)times a constant, c, for the asymptotic cases when n≥n0.\\nHowever, it is considered poor taste to say “ f(n)≤O(g(n)),” since the big-Oh\\nalready denotes the “less-than-or-equal-to” concept. Likewise, although common,\\nit is not fully correct to say “ f(n)=O(g(n)),” with the usual understanding of the\\n“=” relation, because there is no way to make sense of the symmetric statement,\\n“O(g(n)) = f(n).” It is best to say,\\n“f(n)isO(g(n)).”\\nAlternatively, we can say “ f(n)isorder of g(n).” For the more mathematically\\ninclined, it is also correct to say, “ f(n)∈O(g(n)),” for the big-Oh notation, techni-\\ncally speaking, denotes a whole collection of functions. In this book, we will stickto presenting big-Oh statements as “ f(n)isO(g(n)).” Even with this interpretation,\\nthere is considerable freedom in how we can use arithmetic operations with the big-\\nOh notation, and with this freedom comes a certain amount of responsibility.'),\n",

For example, if weare interested in ﬁnding the largest element in a sequence, as with the ﬁnd\\nmax\\nalgorithm, we should let ndenote the number of elements in that collection. Using\\nthe big-Oh notation, we can write the following mathematically precise statementon the running time of algorithm ﬁnd\\nmax (Code Fragment 3.1) for anycomputer.\\nProposition 3.7: The algorithm, ﬁnd\\n max, for computing the maximum element\\nof a list of nnumbers, runs in O(n)time.\\nJustiﬁcation: The initialization before the loop begins requires only a constant\\nnumber of primitive operations. Each iteration of the loop also requires only a con-stant number of primitive operations, and the loop executes ntimes. Therefore,\\nwe account for the number of primitive operations being c\\n′+c′′·nfor appropriate\\nconstants c′andc′′that reﬂect, respectively, the work performed during initializa-\\ntion and the loop body. Because each primitive operation runs in constant time, wehave that the running time of algorithm ﬁnd\\nmax on an input of size nis at most a\\nconstant times n; that is, we conclude that the running time of algorithm ﬁnd\\nmax\\nisO(n).\\nSome Properties of the Big-Oh Notation\\nThe big-Oh notation allows us to ignore constant factors and lower-order terms andfocus on the main components of a function that affect its growth.\\nExample 3.8: 5n\\n4+3n3+2n2+4n+1isO(n4).\\nJustiﬁcation: Note that 5n4+3n3+2n2+4n+1≤(5+3+2+4+1)n4=cn4,\\nforc=15,w h e n n≥n0=1.\\nIn fact, we can characterize the growth rate of any polynomial function.\\nProposition 3.9: Iff(n)is a polynomial of degree d,t h a ti s ,\\nf(n)=a0+a1n+···+adnd,\\nandad>0,t h e n f(n)isO(nd).\\nJustiﬁcation: Note that, for n≥1, we have 1 ≤n≤n2≤···≤ nd; hence,\\na0+a1n+a2n2+···+adnd≤(|a0|+|a1|+|a2|+···+|ad|)nd.\\nWe show that f(n)isO(nd)by deﬁning c=|a0|+|a1|+···+|ad|andn0=1.\\n'),\n",

While it is true that the function f(n)=4n\\n3+3n2isO(n5)or even\\nO(n4), it is more accurate to say that f(n)isO(n3). Consider, by way of analogy,\\na scenario where a hungry traveler driving along a long country road happens upona local farmer walking home from a market. If the traveler asks the farmer how\\nmuch longer he must drive before he can ﬁnd some food, it may be truthful for the\\nfarmer to say, “certainly no longer than 12 hours,” but it is much more accurate(and helpful) for him to say, “you can ﬁnd a market just a few minutes drive up thisroad.” Thus, even with the big-Oh notation, we should strive as much as possibleto tell the whole truth.\\nIt is also considered poor taste to include constant factors and lower-order terms\\nin the big-Oh notation. For example, it is not fashionable to say that the function2n\\n2isO(4n2+6nlogn), although this is completely correct. We should strive\\ninstead to describe the function in the big-Oh in simplest terms .'),\n",

Asymptotic Analysis 129\\nThe importance of good algorithm design goes beyond just what can be solved\\neffectively on a given computer, however. As shown in Table 3.4, even if we\\nachieve a dramatic speedup in hardware, we still cannot overcome the handicapof an asymptotically slow algorithm. This table shows the new maximum problemsize achievable for any ﬁxed amount of time, assuming algorithms with the givenrunning times are now run on a computer 256 times faster than the previous one.\\nRunning Time\\n New Maximum Problem Size\\n400n\\n 256m\\n2n2\\n16m\\n2n\\nm+8\\nTable 3.4: Increase in the maximum size of a problem that can be solved in a ﬁxed\\namount of time, by using a computer that is 256 times faster than the previous one.Each entry is a function of m, the previous maximum problem size.\\nSome Words of Caution\\nA few words of caution about asymptotic notation are in order at this point. First,note that the use of the big-Oh and related notations can be somewhat misleadingshould the constant factors they “hide” be very large. For example, while it is true\\nthat the function 10\\n100nisO(n), if this is the running time of an algorithm being\\ncompared to one whose running time is 10 nlogn, we should prefer the O(nlogn)-\\ntime algorithm, even though the linear-time algorithm is asymptotically faster. This\\npreference is because the constant factor, 10100, which is called “one googol,” is\\nbelieved by many astronomers to be an upper bound on the number of atoms in\\nthe observable universe. So we are unlikely to ever have a real-world problem that\\nhas this number as its input size. Thus, even when using the big-Oh notation, weshould at least be somewhat mindful of the constant factors and lower-order termswe are “hiding.”\\nThe observation above raises the issue of what constitutes a “fast” algorithm.\\nGenerally speaking, any algorithm running in O(nlogn)time (with a reasonable\\nconstant factor) should be considered efﬁcient. Even an O(n\\n2)-time function may\\nbe fast enough in some contexts, that is, when nis small. But an algorithm running\\ninO(2n)time should almost never be considered efﬁcient.\\nExponential Running Times\\nThere is a famous story about the inventor of the game of chess. He asked only thathis king pay him 1 grain of rice for the ﬁrst square on the board, 2 grains for thesecond, 4 grains for the third, 8 for the fourth, and so on. It is an interesting test ofprogramming skills to write a program to compute exactly the number of grains of\\nrice the king would have to pay.'),\n",

Algorithm Analysis\\nIf we must draw a line between efﬁcient and inefﬁcient algorithms, therefore,\\nit is natural to make this distinction be that between those algorithms running in\\npolynomial time and those running in exponential time. That is, make the distinc-tion between algorithms with a running time that is O(n\\nc), for some constant c>1,\\nand those with a running time that is O(bn), for some constant b>1. Like so many\\nnotions we have discussed in this section, this too should be taken with a “grain of\\nsalt,” for an algorithm running in O(n100)time should probably not be considered\\n“efﬁcient.” Even so, the distinction between polynomial-time and exponential-time\\nalgorithms is considered a robust measure of tractability.\\n3.3.3 Examples of Algorithm Analysis\\nNow that we have the big-Oh notation for doing algorithm analysis, let us give someexamples by characterizing the running time of some simple algorithms using thisnotation. Moreover, in keeping with our earlier promise, we illustrate below how\\neach of the seven functions given earlier in this chapter can be used to characterize\\nthe running time of an example algorithm.\\nRather than use pseudo-code in this section, we give complete Python imple-\\nmentations for our examples. We use Python’s listclass as the natural representa-\\ntion for an “array” of values. In Chapter 5, we will fully explore the underpinningsof Python’s listclass, and the efﬁciency of the various behaviors that it supports. In\\nthis section, we rely on just a few of its behaviors, discussing their efﬁciencies asintroduced.\\nConstant-Time Operations\\nGiven an instance, named data, of the Python listclass, a call to the function,\\nlen(data) , is evaluated in constant time. This is a very simple algorithm because\\nthelistclass maintains, for each list, an instance variable that records the current\\nlength of the list. This allows it to immediately report that length, rather than taketime to iteratively count each of the elements in the list. Using asymptotic notation,we say that this function runs in O(1)time; that is, the running time of this function\\nis independent of the length, n, of the list.\\nAnother central behavior of Python’s listclass is that it allows access to an arbi-\\ntrary element of the list using syntax, data[j] , for integer index j. Because Python’s\\nlists are implemented as array-based sequences , references to a list’s elements are\\nstored in a consecutive block of memory. The j\\nthelement of the list can be found,\\nnot by iterating through the list one element at a time, but by validating the index,and using it as an offset into the underlying array. In turn, computer hardware sup-ports constant-time access to an element based on its memory address. Therefore,\\nwe say that the expression data[j] is evaluated in O(1)time for a Python list.'),\n",

Asymptotic Analysis 131\\nRevisiting the Problem of Finding the Maximum of a Sequence\\nFor our next example, we revisit the ﬁnd\\nmax algorithm, given in Code Frag-\\nment 3.1 on page 123, for ﬁnding the largest value in a sequence. Proposition 3.7\\non page 125 claimed an O(n)run-time for the ﬁnd\\nmax algorithm. Consistent with\\nour earlier analysis of syntax data[0] , the initialization uses O(1)time. The loop\\nexecutes ntimes, and within each iteration, it performs one comparison and possi-\\nbly one assignment statement (as well as maintenance of the loop variable). Finally,\\nwe note that the mechanism for enacting a return statement in Python uses O(1)\\ntime. Combining these steps, we have that the ﬁnd\\nmax function runs in O(n)time.\\nFurther Analysis of the Maximum-Finding Algorithm\\nA more interesting question about ﬁnd\\nmax is how many times we might update\\nthe current “biggest” value. In the worst case, if the data is given to us in increasingorder, the biggest value is reassigned n−1 times. But what if the input is given\\nto us in random order, with all orders equally likely; what would be the expectednumber of times we update the biggest value in this case? To answer this question,note that we update the current biggest in an iteration of the loop only if the currentelement is bigger than all the elements that precede it. If the sequence is given tous in random order, the probability that the j\\nthelement is the largest of the ﬁrst j\\nelements is 1 /j(assuming uniqueness). Hence, the expected number of times we\\nupdate the biggest (including initialization) is Hn=∑n\\nj=11/j, which is known as\\nthenthHarmonic number . It turns out (see Proposition B.16) that HnisO(logn).\\nTherefore, the expected number of times the biggest value is updated by ﬁnd\\nmax\\non a randomly ordered sequence is O(logn).\\nPreﬁx Averages\\nThe next problem we consider is computing what are known as preﬁx averages\\nof a sequence of numbers. Namely, given a sequence Sconsisting of nnum-\\nbers, we want to compute a sequence Asuch that A[j]is the average of elements\\nS[0],..., S[j],f o r j=0,..., n−1, that is,\\nA[j]=∑j\\ni=0S[i]\\nj+1.\\nComputing preﬁx averages has many applications in economics and statistics. For\\nexample, given the year-by-year returns of a mutual fund, ordered from recent to\\npast, an investor will typically want to see the fund’s average annual returns for themost recent year, the most recent three years, the most recent ﬁve years, and so on.Likewise, given a stream of daily Web usage logs, a Web site manager may wishto track average usage trends over various time periods. We analyze three different\\nimplementations that solve this problem but with rather different running times.'),\n",

Simple Justiﬁcation Techniques 137\\n3.4 Simple Justiﬁcation Techniques\\nSometimes, we will want to make claims about an algorithm, such as showing that\\nit is correct or that it runs fast. In order to rigorously make such claims, we must\\nuse mathematical language, and in order to back up such claims, we must justify orprove our statements. Fortunately, there are several simple ways to do this.\\n3.4.1 By Example\\nSome claims are of the generic form, “There is an element xin a set Sthat has\\nproperty P.” To justify such a claim, we only need to produce a particular xinS\\nthat has property P. Likewise, some hard-to-believe claims are of the generic form,\\n“Every element xin a set Shas property P.” To justify that such a claim is false, we\\nonly need to produce a particular xfrom Sthat does not have property P.S u c ha n\\ninstance is called a counterexample .\\nExample 3.17: Professor Amongus claims that every number of the form 2i−1\\nis a prime, when iis an integer greater than 1. Professor Amongus is wrong.\\nJustiﬁcation: To prove Professor Amongus is wrong, we ﬁnd a counterexample.\\nFortunately, we need not look too far, for 24−1=15=3·5.\\n3.4.2 The “Contra” Attack\\nAnother set of justiﬁcation techniques involves the use of the negative. The twoprimary such methods are the use of the contrapositive and the contradiction .T h e\\nuse of the contrapositive method is like looking through a negative mirror. To\\njustify the statement “if pis true, then qis true,” we establish that “if qis not true,\\nthen pis not true” instead. Logically, these two statements are the same, but the\\nlatter, which is called the contrapositive of the ﬁrst, may be easier to think about.\\nExample 3.18:\\nLetaandbbe integers. If abis even, then ais even or bis even.\\nJustiﬁcation: To justify this claim, consider the contrapositive, “If ais odd and\\nbis odd, then abis odd.” So, suppose a=2j+1a n d b=2k+1, for some integers\\njandk.T h e n ab=4jk+2j+2k+1=2(2jk+j+k)+1; hence, abis odd.\\nBesides showing a use of the contrapositive justiﬁcation technique, the previous\\nexample also contains an application of DeMorgan’s Law . This law helps us deal\\nwith negations, for it states that the negation of a statement of the form “ porq”i s\\n“not pand not q.” Likewise, it states that the negation of a statement of the form\\n“pandq” is “not por not q.”'),\n",

Algorithm Analysis\\nContradiction\\nAnother negative justiﬁcation technique is justiﬁcation by contradiction ,w h i c h\\nalso often involves using DeMorgan’s Law. In applying the justiﬁcation by con-\\ntradiction technique, we establish that a statement qis true by ﬁrst supposing that\\nqis false and then showing that this assumption leads to a contradiction (such as\\n2̸=2o r1 >3). By reaching such a contradiction, we show that no consistent sit-\\nuation exists with qbeing false, so qmust be true. Of course, in order to reach this\\nconclusion, we must be sure our situation is consistent before we assume qis false.\\nExample 3.19: Letaandbbe integers. If abis odd, then ais odd and bis odd.\\nJustiﬁcation: Letabbe odd. We wish to show that ais odd and bis odd. So,\\nwith the hope of leading to a contradiction, let us assume the opposite, namely,\\nsuppose ais even or bis even. In fact, without loss of generality, we can assume\\nthatais even (since the case for bis symmetric). Then a=2jfor some integer\\nj. Hence, ab=(2j)b=2(jb),t h a ti s , abis even. But this is a contradiction: ab\\ncannot simultaneously be odd and even. Therefore, ais odd and bis odd.\\n3.4.3 Induction and Loop Invariants\\nMost of the claims we make about a running time or a space bound involve an inte-ger parameter n(usually denoting an intuitive notion of the “size” of the problem).\\nMoreover, most of these claims are equivalent to saying some statement q(n)is true\\n“for all n≥1.” Since this is making a claim about an inﬁnite set of numbers, we\\ncannot justify this exhaustively in a direct fashion.\\nInduction\\nWe can often justify claims such as those above as true, however, by using thetechnique of induction . This technique amounts to showing that, for any particular\\nn≥1, there is a ﬁnite sequence of implications that starts with something known\\nto be true and ultimately leads to showing that q(n)is true. Speciﬁcally, we begin a\\njustiﬁcation by induction by showing that q(n)is true for n=1 (and possibly some\\nother values n=2,3,..., k, for some constant k).

An\\nentirely different way to achieve repetition is through a process known as recursion .\\nRecursion is a technique by which a function makes one or more calls to itself\\nduring execution, or by which a data structure relies upon smaller instances of\\nthe very same type of structure in its representation. There are many examples ofrecursion in art and nature. For example, fractal patterns are naturally recursive. Aphysical example of recursion used in art is in the Russian Matryoshka dolls. Each\\ndoll is either made of solid wood, or is hollow and contains another Matryoshka\\ndoll inside it.\\nIn computing, recursion provides an elegant and powerful alternative for per-\\nforming repetitive tasks. In fact, a few programming languages (e.g., Scheme,Smalltalk) do not explicitly support looping constructs and instead rely directlyon recursion to express repetition. Most modern programming languages supportfunctional recursion using the identical mechanism that is used to support tradi-\\ntional forms of function calls. When one invocation of the function make a recur-\\nsive call, that invocation is suspended until the recursive call completes.\\nRecursion is an important technique in the study of data structures and algo-\\nrithms. We will use it prominently in several later chapters of this book (mostnotably, Chapters 8 and 12). In this chapter, we begin with the following four il-lustrative examples of the use of recursion, providing a Python implementation foreach.\\n•Thefactorial function (commonly denoted as n!) is a classic mathematical\\nfunction that has a natural recursive deﬁnition.\\n•AnEnglish ruler has a recursive pattern that is a simple example of a fractal\\nstructure.\\n•Binary search is among the most important computer algorithms. It allows\\nus to efﬁciently locate a desired value in a data set with upwards of billionsof entries.\\n•Theﬁle system for a computer has a recursive structure in which directories\\ncan be nested arbitrarily deeply within other directories. Recursive algo-\\nrithms are widely used to explore and manage these ﬁle systems.\\nWe then describe how to perform a formal analysis of the running time of a\\nrecursive algorithm and we discuss some potential pitfalls when deﬁning recur-\\nsions. In the balance of the chapter, we provide many more examples of recursive\\nalgorithms, organized to highlight some common forms of design.'),\n",

Recursion\\n4.1 Illustrative Examples\\n4.1.1 The Factorial Function\\nTo demonstrate the mechanics of recursion, we begin with a simple mathematical\\nexample of computing the value of the factorial function . The factorial of a posi-\\ntive integer n, denoted n!, is deﬁned as the product of the integers from 1 to n.I f\\nn=0, then n! is deﬁned as 1 by convention. More formally, for any integer n≥0,\\nn!={1i fn=0\\nn·(n−1)·(n−2)···3·2·1i f n≥1.\\nFor example, 5! =5·4·3·2·1=120. The factorial function is important because\\nit is known to equal the number of ways in which ndistinct items can be arranged\\ninto a sequence, that is, the number of permutations ofnitems. For example, the\\nthree characters a,b,a n d ccan be arranged in 3! =3·2·1=6 ways: abc, acb,\\nbac, bca, cab,a n d cba.\\nThere is a natural recursive deﬁnition for the factorial function. To see this,\\nobserve that 5! =5·(4·3·2·1)=5·4!. More generally, for a positive integer n,\\nwe can deﬁne n!t ob e n·(n−1)!. This recursive deﬁnition can be formalized as\\nn!={1i fn=0\\nn·(n−1)!i fn≥1.\\nThis deﬁnition is typical of many recursive deﬁnitions.

Recursion\\n4.1.2 Drawing an English Ruler\\nIn the case of computing a factorial, there is no compelling reason for preferring\\nrecursion over a direct iteration with a loop. As a more complex example of the\\nuse of recursion, consider how to draw the markings of a typical English ruler. For\\neach inch, we place a tick with a numeric label. We denote the length of the tickdesignating a whole inch as the major tick length. Between the marks for whole\\ninches, the ruler contains a series of minor ticks , placed at intervals of 1 /2 inch,\\n1/4 inch, and so on. As the size of the interval decreases by half, the tick length\\ndecreases by one. Figure 4.2 demonstrates several such rulers with varying majortick lengths (although not drawn to scale).\\n---- 0 ----- 0 --- 0\\n----- -- --\\n---\\n--- --- --- 1\\n---\\n-- -- --\\n---\\n---- 1 ---- --- 2\\n---\\n-- -- --\\n------ --- --- 3\\n--\\n-- --\\n--\\n---- 2 ----- 1\\n(a) (b) (c)\\nFigure 4.2: Three sample outputs of an English ruler drawing: (a) a 2-inch ruler\\nwith major tick length 4; (b) a 1-inch ruler with major tick length 5; (c) a 3-inchruler with major tick length 3.\\nA Recursive Approach to Ruler Drawing\\nThe English ruler pattern is a simple example of a fractal , that is, a shape that has\\na self-recursive structure at various levels of magniﬁcation. Consider the rule withmajor tick length 5 shown in Figure 4.2(b). Ignoring the lines containing 0 and 1,let us consider how to draw the sequence of ticks lying between these lines.

Inthis section, we consider one such algorithm: computing the total disk usage for all\\nﬁles and directories nested within a particular directory.\\nFor illustration, Figure 4.7 portrays the disk space being used by all entries in\\nour sample ﬁle system.

Analyzing Recursive Algorithms 161\\n4.2 Analyzing Recursive Algorithms\\nIn Chapter 3, we introduced mathematical techniques for analyzing the efﬁciency\\nof an algorithm, based upon an estimate of the number of primitive operations that\\nare executed by the algorithm. We use notations such as big-Oh to summarize therelationship between the number of operations and the input size for a problem. Inthis section, we demonstrate how to perform this type of running-time analysis torecursive algorithms.\\nWith a recursive algorithm, we will account for each operation that is performed\\nbased upon the particular activation of the function that manages the ﬂow of control\\nat the time it is executed. Stated another way, for each invocation of the function,we only account for the number of operations that are performed within the body ofthat activation. We can then account for the overall number of operations that are\\nexecuted as part of the recursive algorithm by taking the sum, over all activations,\\nof the number of operations that take place during each individual activation. (Asan aside, this is also the way we analyze a nonrecursive function that calls otherfunctions from within its body.)\\nTo demonstrate this style of analysis, we revisit the four recursive algorithms\\npresented in Sections 4.1.1 through 4.1.4: factorial computation, drawing an En-glish ruler, binary search, and computation of the cumulative size of a ﬁle system.In general, we may rely on the intuition afforded by a recursion trace in recogniz-\\ning how many recursive activations occur, and how the parameterization of each\\nactivation can be used to estimate the number of primitive operations that occur\\nwithin the body of that activation. However, each of these recursive algorithms hasa unique structure and form.\\nComputing Factorials\\nIt is relatively easy to analyze the efﬁciency of our function for computing fac-torials, as described in Section 4.1.1. A sample recursion trace for our factorial\\nfunction was given in Figure 4.1. To compute factorial(n) , we see that there are a\\ntotal of n+1 activations, as the parameter decreases from nin the ﬁrst call, to n−1\\nin the second call, and so on, until reaching the base case with parameter 0.\\nIt is also clear, given an examination of the function body in Code Fragment 4.1,\\nthat each individual activation of factorial executes a constant number of opera-\\ntions. Therefore, we conclude that the overall number of operations for computingfactorial(n) isO(n),a st h e r ea r e n+1 activations, each of which accounts for O(1)\\noperations.'),\n",

Recursion\\nDrawing an English Ruler\\nIn analyzing the English ruler application from Section 4.1.2, we consider the fun-\\ndamental question of how many total lines of output are generated by an initial call\\ntodraw\\ninterval(c) ,w h e r e cdenotes the center length. This is a reasonable bench-\\nmark for the overall efﬁciency of the algorithm as each line of output is based upona call to the draw\\nlineutility, and each recursive call to draw\\ninterval with nonzero\\nparameter makes exactly one direct call to draw\\nline.\\nSome intuition may be gained by examining the source code and the recur-\\nsion trace. We know that a call to draw\\ninterval(c) forc>0 spawns two calls to\\ndraw\\ninterval(c −1)and a single call to draw\\nline. We will rely on this intuition to\\nprove the following claim.\\nProposition 4.1: Forc≥0, a call to draw\\n interval(c) results in precisely 2c−1\\nlines of output.\\nJustiﬁcation: We provide a formal proof of this claim by induction (see Sec-\\ntion 3.4.3). In fact, induction is a natural mathematical technique for proving the\\ncorrectness and efﬁciency of a recursive process. In the case of the ruler, we\\nnote that an application of draw\\ninterval(0) generates no output, and that 20−1=\\n1−1=0. This serves as a base case for our claim.\\nMore generally, the number of lines printed by draw\\ninterval(c) is one more\\nthan twice the number generated by a call to draw\\ninterval(c −1), as one center\\nline is printed between two such recursive calls. By induction, we have that thenumber of lines is thus 1 +2·(2\\nc−1−1)=1+2c−2=2c−1.\\nThis proof is indicative of a more mathematically rigorous tool, known as a\\nrecurrence equation that can be used to analyze the running time of a recursive\\nalgorithm. That technique is discussed in Section 12.2.4, in the context of recursivesorting algorithms.\\nPerforming a Binary Search\\nConsidering the running time of the binary search algorithm, as presented in Sec-tion 4.1.3, we observe that a constant number of primitive operations are executedat each recursive call of method of a binary search. Hence, the running time isproportional to the number of recursive calls performed. We will show that at most⌊logn⌋+1 recursive calls are made during a binary search of a sequence having n\\nelements, leading to the following claim.\\nProposition 4.2:\\nThe binary search algorithm runs in O(logn)time for a sorted\\nsequence with nelements.'),\n",

Analyzing Recursive Algorithms 163\\nJustiﬁcation: To prove this claim, a crucial fact is that with each recursive call\\nthe number of candidate entries still to be searched is given by the value\\nhigh−low +1.\\nMoreover, the number of remaining candidates is reduced by at least one half with\\neach recursive call. Speciﬁcally, from the deﬁnition of mid, the number of remain-\\ning candidates is either\\n(mid−1)−low +1=⌊low +high\\n2⌋\\n−low≤high−low +1\\n2\\nor\\nhigh−(mid +1)+1=high−⌊low +high\\n2⌋\\n≤high−low +1\\n2.\\nInitially, the number of candidates is n; after the ﬁrst call in a binary search, it is at\\nmost n/2; after the second call, it is at most n/4; and so on. In general, after the jth\\ncall in a binary search, the number of candidate entries remaining is at most n/2j.\\nIn the worst case (an unsuccessful search), the recursive calls stop when there are nomore candidate entries.

To characterize the “prob-lem size” for our analysis, we let ndenote the number of ﬁle-system entries in the\\nportion of the ﬁle system that is considered. (For example, the ﬁle system portrayed\\nin Figure 4.6 has n=19 entries.)\\nTo characterize the cumulative time spent for an initial call to the disk\\nusage\\nfunction, we must analyze the total number of recursive invocations that are made,\\nas well as the number of operations that are executed within those invocations.\\nWe begin by showing that there are precisely nrecursive invocations of the\\nfunction, in particular, one for each entry in the relevant portion of the ﬁle system.Intuitively, this is because a call to disk\\nusage for a particular entry eof the ﬁle\\nsystem is only made from within the for loop of Code Fragment 4.5 when process-ing the entry for the unique directory that contains e, and that entry will only be\\nexplored once.'),\n",

Recursion\\nTo formalize this argument, we can deﬁne the nesting level of each entry such\\nthat the entry on which we begin has nesting level 0, entries stored directly within\\nit have nesting level 1, entries stored within those entries have nesting level 2, andso on. We can prove by induction that there is exactly one recursive invocation ofdisk\\nusage upon each entry at nesting level k. As a base case, when k=0, the only\\nrecursive invocation made is the initial one. As the inductive step, once we know\\nthere is exactly one recursive invocation for each entry at nesting level k, we can\\nclaim that there is exactly one invocation for each entry eat nesting level k,m a d e\\nwithin the for loop for the entry at level kthat contains e.\\nHaving established that there is one recursive call for each entry of the ﬁle\\nsystem, we return to the question of the overall computation time for the algorithm.It would be great if we could argue that we spend O(1)time in any single invocation\\nof the function, but that is not the case. While there are a constant number of\\nsteps reﬂect in the call to os.path.getsize to compute the disk usage directly at that\\nentry, when the entry is a directory, the body of the disk\\nusage function includes a\\nfor loop that iterates over all entries that are contained within that directory. In the\\nworst case, it is possible that one entry includes n−1 others.\\nBased on this reasoning, we could conclude that there are O(n)recursive calls,\\neach of which runs in O(n)time, leading to an overall running time that is O(n2).\\nWhile this upper bound is technically true, it is not a tight upper bound. Remark-\\nably, we can prove the stronger bound that the recursive algorithm for disk\\nusage\\ncompletes in O(n)time! The weaker bound was pessimistic because it assumed\\na worst-case number of entries for each directory. While it is possible that somedirectories contain a number of entries proportional to n, they cannot all contain\\nthat many. To prove the stronger claim, we choose to consider the overall number\\nof iterations of the for loop across all recursive calls. We claim there are preciselyn−1 such iteration of that loop overall. We base this claim on the fact that each\\niteration of that loop makes a recursive call to disk\\nusage , and yet we have already\\nconcluded that there are a total of ncalls to disk\\nusage (including the original call).\\nWe therefore conclude that there are O(n)recursive calls, each of which uses O(1)\\ntime outside the loop, and that the overall number of operations due to the loop\\nisO(n). Summing all of these bounds, the overall number of operations is O(n).\\nThe argument we have made is more advanced than with the earlier examples\\nof recursion. The idea that we can sometimes get a tighter bound on a series ofoperations by considering the cumulative effect, rather than assuming that each\\nachieves a worst case is a technique called amortization ; we will see a further\\nexample of such analysis in Section 5.3. Furthermore, a ﬁle system is an implicit\\nexample of a data structure known as a tree, and our disk usage algorithm is really\\na manifestation of a more general algorithm known as a tree traversal . Trees will\\nbe the focus of Chapter 8, and our argument about the O(n)running time of the\\ndisk usage algorithm will be generalized for tree traversals in Section 8.4.'),\n",

We can use the following recursive formulation to determine ifallnelements of a sequence are unique. As a base case, when n=1, the elements\\nare trivially unique. For n≥2, the elements are unique if and only if the ﬁrst n−1\\nelements are unique, the last n−1 items are unique, and the ﬁrst and last elements\\nare different (as that is the only pair that was not already checked as a subcase). Arecursive implementation based on this idea is given in Code Fragment 4.6, namedunique3 (to differentiate it from unique1 andunique2 from Chapter 3).\\n1defunique3(S, start, stop):\\n2”””Return True if there are no duplicate elements in slice S[start:stop].”””\\n3ifstop−start<=1 :return True #a tm o s to n ei t e m\\n4elif not unique(S, start, stop −1):return False # ﬁrst part has duplicate\\n5elif not unique(S, start+1, stop): return False # second part has duplicate\\n6else:return S[start] != S[stop −1] # do ﬁrst and last diﬀer?\\nCode Fragment 4.6: Recursive unique3 for testing element uniqueness.\\nUnfortunately, this is a terribly inefﬁcient use of recursion. The nonrecursive\\npart of each call uses O(1)time, so the overall running time will be proportional to\\nthe total number of recursive invocations. To analyze the problem, we let ndenote\\nthe number of entries under consideration, that is, let n= stop−start .\\nIfn=1, then the running time of unique3 isO(1), since there are no recursive\\ncalls for this case. In the general case, the important observation is that a single calltounique3 for a problem of size nmay result in two recursive calls on problems of\\nsizen−1. Those two calls with size n−1 could in turn result in four calls (two\\neach) with a range of size n−2, and thus eight calls with size n−3 and so on.\\nThus, in the worst case, the total number of function calls is given by the geometricsummation\\n1+2+4+···+2\\nn−1,\\nwhich is equal to 2n−1 by Proposition 3.5. Thus, the running time of function\\nunique3 isO(2n). This is an incredibly inefﬁcient function for solving the ele-\\nment uniqueness problem. Its inefﬁciency comes not from the fact that it usesrecursion—it comes from the fact that it uses recursion poorly, which is something\\nwe address in Exercise C-4.11.'),\n",

Recursion Run Amok 167\\nAn Eﬃcient Recursion for Computing Fibonacci Numbers\\nWe were tempted into using the bad recursion formulation because of the way the\\nnthFibonacci number, Fn, depends on the two previous values, Fn−2andFn−1.B u t\\nnotice that after computing Fn−2, the call to compute Fn−1requires its own recursive\\ncall to compute Fn−2, as it does not have knowledge of the value of Fn−2that was\\ncomputed at the earlier level of recursion. That is duplicative work. Worse yet, both\\nof those calls will need to (re)compute the value of Fn−3, as will the computation\\nofFn−1. This snowballing effect is what leads to the exponential running time of\\nbad\\nrecursion .\\nWe can compute Fnmuch more efﬁciently using a recursion in which each invo-\\ncation makes only one recursive call. To do so, we need to redeﬁne the expectationsof the function. Rather than having the function return a single value, which is then\\nthFibonacci number, we deﬁne a recursive function that returns a pair of con-\\nsecutive Fibonacci numbers (Fn,Fn−1), using the convention F−1=0. Although\\nit seems to be a greater burden to report two consecutive Fibonacci numbers in-\\nstead of one, passing this extra information from one level of the recursion to the\\nnext makes it much easier to continue the process. (It allows us to avoid havingto recompute the second value that was already known within the recursion.)

Recursion\\n4.3.1 Maximum Recursive Depth in Python\\nAnother danger in the misuse of recursion is known as inﬁnite recursion . If each\\nrecursive call makes another recursive call, without ever reaching a base case, then\\nwe have an inﬁnite series of such calls. This is a fatal error. An inﬁnite recursioncan quickly swamp computing resources, not only due to rapid use of the CPU,but because each successive call creates an activation record requiring additionalmemory. A blatant example of an ill-formed recursion is the following:\\ndefﬁb(n):\\nreturn ﬁb(n) # ﬁb(n) equals ﬁb(n)\\nHowever, there are far more subtle errors that can lead to an inﬁnite recursion.\\nRevisiting our implementation of binary search in Code Fragment 4.3, in the ﬁnalcase (line 17) we make a recursive call on the right portion of the sequence, inparticular going from index mid+1 tohigh. Had that line instead been written as\\nreturn binary\\nsearch(data, target, mid, high) # note the use of mid\\nthis could result in an inﬁnite recursion. In particular, when searching a range of\\ntwo elements, it becomes possible to make a recursive call on the identical range.\\nA programmer should ensure that each recursive call is in some way progress-\\ning toward a base case (for example, by having a parameter value that decreases\\nwith each call). However, to combat against inﬁnite recursions, the designers ofPython made an intentional decision to limit the overall number of function acti-vations that can be simultaneously active. The precise value of this limit dependsupon the Python distribution, but a typical default value is 1000. If this limit is\\nreached, the Python interpreter raises a RuntimeError with a message, maximum\\nrecursion depth exceeded.\\nFor many legitimate applications of recursion, a limit of 1000 nested function\\ncalls sufﬁces. For example, our binary\\nsearch function (Section 4.1.3) has O(logn)\\nrecursive depth, and so for the default recursive limit to be reached, there would\\nneed to be 21000elements (far, far more than the estimated number of atoms in the\\nuniverse). However, in the next section we discuss several algorithms that haverecursive depth proportional to n. Python’s artiﬁcial limit on the recursive depth\\ncould disrupt such otherwise legitimate computations.\\nFortunately, the Python interpreter can be dynamically reconﬁgured to change\\nthe default recursive limit. This is done through use of a module named sys,w h i c h\\nsupports a getrecursionlimit function and a setrecursionlimit . Sample usage of\\nthose functions is demonstrated as follows:\\nimport sys\\nold = sys.getrecursionlimit( ) # perhaps 1000 is typical\\nsys.setrecursionlimit(1000000) # change to allow 1 million nested calls'),\n",

Further Examples of Recursion 169\\n4.4 Further Examples of Recursion\\nIn the remainder of this chapter, we provide additional examples of the use of re-\\ncursion. We organize our presentation by considering the maximum number of\\nrecursive calls that may be started from within the body of a single activation.\\n•If a recursive call starts at most one other, we call this a linear recursion .\\n•If a recursive call may start two others, we call this a binary recursion .\\n•If a recursive call may start three or more others, this is multiple recursion .\\n4.4.1 Linear Recursion\\nIf a recursive function is designed so that each invocation of the body makes at\\nmost one new recursive call, this is know as linear recursion . Of the recursions we\\nhave seen so far, the implementation of the factorial function (Section 4.1.1) andthegood\\nﬁbonacci function (Section 4.3) are clear examples of linear recursion.\\nMore interestingly, the binary search algorithm (Section 4.1.3) is also an example\\noflinear recursion , despite the “binary” terminology in the name. The code for\\nbinary search (Code Fragment 4.3) includes a case analysis with two branches that\\nlead to recursive calls, but only one of those calls can be reached during a particularexecution of the body.\\nA consequence of the deﬁnition of linear recursion is that any recursion trace\\nwill appear as a single sequence of calls, as we originally portrayed for the factorialfunction in Figure 4.1 of Section 4.1.1. Note that the linear recursion terminol-\\nogy reﬂects the structure of the recursion trace, not the asymptotic analysis of the\\nrunning time; for example, we have seen that binary search runs in O(logn)time.\\nSumming the Elements of a Sequence Recursively\\nLinear recursion can be a useful tool for processing a data sequence, such as a\\nPython list. Suppose, for example, that we want to compute the sum of a sequence,S,o fnintegers.

Our recursion for an-\\nalyzing the disk space usage of a ﬁle system (see Section 4.1.4) is an example of\\nmultiple recursion, because the number of recursive calls made during one invoca-tion was equal to the number of entries within a given directory of the ﬁle system.\\nAnother common application of multiple recursion is when we want to enumer-\\nate various conﬁgurations in order to solve a combinatorial puzzle. For example,\\nthe following are all instances of what are known as summation puzzles :\\npot +pan =bib\\ndog +cat =pig\\nboy +girl =baby\\nTo solve such a puzzle, we need to assign a unique digit (that is, 0 ,1,..., 9) to each\\nletter in the equation, in order to make the equation true. Typically, we solve such\\na puzzle by using our human observations of the particular puzzle we are tryingto solve to eliminate conﬁgurations (that is, possible partial assignments of digits\\nto letters) until we can work though the feasible conﬁgurations left, testing for the\\ncorrectness of each one.\\nIf the number of possible conﬁgurations is not too large, however, we can use\\na computer to simply enumerate all the possibilities and test each one, withoutemploying any human observations. In addition, such an algorithm can use multiple\\nrecursion to work through the conﬁgurations in a systematic way. We show pseudo-\\ncode for such an algorithm in Code Fragment 4.14. To keep the description generalenough to be used with other puzzles, the algorithm enumerates and tests all k-\\nlength sequences without repetitions of the elements of a given universe U.W e\\nbuild the sequences of kelements by the following steps:\\n1. Recursively generating the sequences of k−1e l e m e n t s\\n2. Appending to each such sequence an element not already contained in it.\\nThroughout the execution of the algorithm, we use a set Uto keep track of the\\nelements not contained in the current sequence, so that an element ehas not been\\nused yet if and only if eis in U.\\nAnother way to look at the algorithm of Code Fragment 4.14 is that it enumer-\\nates every possible size- kordered subset of U, and tests each subset for being a\\npossible solution to our puzzle.\\nFor summation puzzles, U={0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}and each position in the\\nsequence corresponds to a given letter. For example, the ﬁrst position could stand\\nforb, the second for o, the third for y, and so on.'),\n",

Designing Recursive Algorithms 177\\n4.5 Designing Recursive Algorithms\\nIn general, an algorithm that uses recursion typically has the following form:\\n•Test for base cases. We begin by testing for a set of base cases (there should\\nbe at least one). These base cases should be deﬁned so that every possible\\nchain of recursive calls will eventually reach a base case, and the handling ofeach base case should not use recursion.\\n•Recur. If not a base case, we perform one or more recursive calls. This recur-\\nsive step may involve a test that decides which of several possible recursivecalls to make. We should deﬁne each possible recursive call so that it makes\\nprogress towards a base case.\\nParameterizing a Recursion\\nTo design a recursive algorithm for a given problem, it is useful to think of the\\ndifferent ways we might deﬁne subproblems that have the same general structureas the original problem. If one has difﬁculty ﬁnding the repetitive structure neededto design a recursive algorithm, it is sometimes useful to work out the problem on\\na few concrete examples to see how the subproblems should be deﬁned.\\nA successful recursive design sometimes requires that we redeﬁne the original\\nproblem to facilitate similar-looking subproblems. Often, this involved reparam-\\neterizing the signature of the function. For example, when performing a binarysearch in a sequence, a natural function signature for a caller would appear asbinary\\nsearch(data, target). However, in Section 4.1.3, we deﬁned our function\\nwith calling signature binary\\n search(data, target, low, high) , using the additional\\nparameters to demarcate sublists as the recursion proceeds. This change in param-eterization is critical for binary search. If we had insisted on the cleaner signature,binary\\nsearch(data, target), the only way to invoke a search on half the list would\\nhave been to make a new list instance with only those elements to send as the ﬁrstparameter. However, making a copy of half the list would already take O(n)time,\\nnegating the whole beneﬁt of the binary search algorithm.\\nIf we wished to provide a cleaner public interface to an algorithm like bi-\\nnary search, without bothering a user with the extra parameters, a standard tech-nique is to make one function for public use with the cleaner interface, such asbinary\\nsearch(data, target), and then having its body invoke a nonpublic utility\\nfunction having the desired recursive parameters.\\nYou will see that we similarly reparameterized the recursion in several other ex-\\namples of this chapter (e.g., reverse ,linear\\n sum,binary\\n sum). We saw a different\\napproach to redeﬁning a recursion in our good\\n ﬁbonacci implementation, by in-\\ntentionally strengthening the expectation of what is returned (in that case, returning\\na pair of numbers rather than a single number).'),\n",

Recursion\\n4.6 Eliminating Tail Recursion\\nThe main beneﬁt of a recursive approach to algorithm design is that it allows us to\\nsuccinctly take advantage of a repetitive structure present in many problems. Bymaking our algorithm description exploit the repetitive structure in a recursive way,we can often avoid complex case analyses and nested loops. This approach can\\nlead to more readable algorithm descriptions, while still being quite efﬁcient.\\nHowever, the usefulness of recursion comes at a modest cost. In particular, the\\nPython interpreter must maintain activation records that keep track of the state ofeach nested call. When computer memory is at a premium, it is useful in some\\ncases to be able to derive nonrecursive algorithms from recursive ones.\\nIn general, we can use the stack data structure, which we will introduce in\\nSection 6.1, to convert a recursive algorithm into a nonrecursive algorithm by man-aging the nesting of the recursive structure ourselves, rather than relying on theinterpreter to do so. Although this only shifts the memory usage from the inter-preter to our stack, we may be able to reduce the memory usage by storing only theminimal information necessary.\\nEven better, some forms of recursion can be eliminated without any use of\\naxillary memory. A notable such form is known as tail recursion . A recursion\\nis a tail recursion if any recursive call that is made from one context is the very\\nlast operation in that context, with the return value of the recursive call (if any)\\nimmediately returned by the enclosing recursion. By necessity, a tail recursionmust be a linear recursion (since there is no way to make a second recursive call ifyou must immediately return the result of the ﬁrst).\\nOf the recursive functions demonstrated in this chapter, the binary\\nsearch func-\\ntion of Code Fragment 4.3 and the reverse function of Code Fragment 4.10 are\\nexamples of tail recursion. Several others of our linear recursions are almost liketail recursion, but not technically so. For example, our factorial function of Code\\nFragment 4.1 is nota tail recursion. It concludes with the command:\\nreturn n\\nfactorial(n −1)\\nThis is not a tail recursion because an additional multiplication is performed after\\nthe recursive call is completed. For similar reasons, the linear\\n sum function of\\nCode Fragment 4.9 and the good\\n ﬁbonacci function of Code Fragment 4.7 fail to\\nbe tail recursions.\\nAny tail recursion can be reimplemented nonrecursively by enclosing the body\\nin a loop for repetition, and replacing a recursive call with new parameters by a\\nreassignment of the existing parameters to those values. As a tangible example, ourbinary\\nsearch function can be reimplemented as shown in Code Fragment 4.15.\\nWe initialize variables lowandhigh, just prior to our while loop, to represent the\\nfull extent of the sequence. Then, during each pass of the loop, we either ﬁnd'),\n",

Array-Based Sequences\\n5.1 Python’s Sequence Types\\nIn this chapter, we explore Python’s various “sequence” classes, namely the built-\\ninlist,tuple ,a n dstrclasses. There is signiﬁcant commonality between these\\nclasses, most notably: each supports indexing to access an individual element of a\\nsequence, using a syntax such as seq[k] , and each uses a low-level concept known\\nas an array to represent the sequence. However, there are signiﬁcant differences in\\nthe abstractions that these classes represent, and in the way that instances of these\\nclasses are represented internally by Python. Because these classes are used so\\nwidely in Python programs, and because they will become building blocks upon\\nwhich we will develop more complex data structures, it is imperative that we estab-lish a clear understanding of both the public behavior and inner workings of theseclasses.\\nPublic Behaviors\\nA proper understanding of the outward semantics for a class is a necessity for agood programmer. While the basic usage of lists, strings, and tuples may seemstraightforward, there are several important subtleties regarding the behaviors as-sociated with these classes (such as what it means to make a copy of a sequence, or\\nto take a slice of a sequence). Having a misunderstanding of a behavior can easily\\nlead to inadvertent bugs in a program. Therefore, we establish an accurate men-tal model for each of these classes. These images will help when exploring moreadvanced usage, such as representing a multidimensional data set as a list of lists.\\nImplementation Details\\nA focus on the internal implementations of these classes seems to go against ourstated principles of object-oriented programming. In Section 2.1.2, we emphasizedthe principle of encapsulation , noting that the user of a class need not know about\\nthe internal details of the implementation. While it is true that one only needs tounderstand the syntax and semantics of a class’s public interface in order to be ableto write legal and correct code that uses instances of the class, the efﬁciency of aprogram depends greatly on the efﬁciency of the components upon which it relies.\\nAsymptotic and Experimental Analyses\\nIn describing the efﬁciency of various operations for Python’s sequence classes,we will rely on the formal asymptotic analysis notations established in Chapter 3.\\nWe will also perform experimental analyses of the primary operations to provide\\nempirical evidence that is consistent with the more theoretical asymptotic analyses.'),\n",

Low-Level Arrays 185\\n5.2 Low-Level Arrays\\nTo accurately describe the way in which Python represents the sequence types,\\nwe must ﬁrst discuss aspects of the low-level computer architecture. The primary\\nmemory of a computer is composed of bits of information, and those bits are typ-\\nically grouped into larger units that depend upon the precise system architecture.Such a typical unit is a byte, which is equivalent to 8 bits.\\nA computer system will have a huge number of bytes of memory, and to keep\\ntrack of what information is stored in what byte, the computer uses an abstractionknown as a memory address . In effect, each byte of memory is associated with a\\nunique number that serves as its address (more formally, the binary representationof the number serves as the address). In this way, the computer system can refer\\nto the data in “byte #2150” versus the data in “byte #2157,” for example. Memory\\naddresses are typically coordinated with the physical layout of the memory system,and so we often portray the numbers in sequential fashion. Figure 5.1 providessuch a diagram, with the designated memory address for each byte.\\n2160 21452146214721482149215021512152215321542155215621572158 2144 2159\\nFigure 5.1: A representation of a portion of a computer’s memory, with individual\\nbytes labeled with consecutive memory addresses.\\nDespite the sequential nature of the numbering system, computer hardware is\\ndesigned, in theory, so that any byte of the main memory can be efﬁciently accessed\\nbased upon its memory address. In this sense, we say that a computer’s main mem-\\nory performs as random access memory (RAM) . That is, it is just as easy to retrieve\\nbyte #8675309 as it is to retrieve byte #309. (In practice, there are complicatingfactors including the use of caches and external memory; we address some of thoseissues in Chapter 15.) Using the notation for asymptotic analysis, we say that any\\nindividual byte of memory can be stored or retrieved in O(1)time.\\nIn general, a programming language keeps track of the association between\\nan identiﬁer and the memory address in which the associated value is stored. Forexample, identiﬁer xmight be associated with one value stored in memory, while y\\nis associated with another value stored in memory. A common programming task\\nis to keep track of a sequence of related objects. For example, we may want a videogame to keep track of the top ten scores for that game. Rather than use ten differentvariables for this task, we would prefer to use a single name for the group and use\\nindex numbers to refer to the high scores in that group.'),\n",

Array-Based Sequences\\nA group of related variables can be stored one after another in a contiguous\\nportion of the computer’s memory. We will denote such a representation as an\\narray . As a tangible example, a text string is stored as an ordered sequence of\\nindividual characters. In Python, each character is represented using the Unicodecharacter set, and on most computing systems, Python internally represents eachUnicode character with 16 bits (i.e., 2 bytes). Therefore, a six-character string, such\\nas\\nSAMPLE\\n , would be stored in 12 consecutive bytes of memory, as diagrammed\\nin Figure 5.2.\\n0M PLE A S2160 215021512152215321542155215621572158 2144 2159\\n5 4 3 2 121452146214721482149\\nFigure 5.2: A Python string embedded as an array of characters in the computer’s\\nmemory. We assume that each Unicode character of the string requires two bytes\\nof memory. The numbers below the entries are indices into the string.\\nW ed e s c r i b et h i sa sa n array of six characters , even though it requires 12 bytes\\nof memory. We will refer to each location within an array as a cell, and will use an\\ninteger index to describe its location within the array, with cells numbered starting\\nwith 0, 1, 2, and so on. For example, in Figure 5.2, the cell of the array with index 4has contents Land is stored in bytes 2154 and 2155 of memory.\\nEach cell of an array must use the same number of bytes. This requirement is\\nwhat allows an arbitrary cell of the array to be accessed in constant time based onits index. In particular, if one knows the memory address at which an array starts\\n(e.g., 2146 in Figure 5.2), the number of bytes per element (e.g., 2 for a Unicode\\ncharacter), and a desired index within the array, the appropriate memory addresscan be computed using the calculation, start + cellsize\\nindex . By this formula,\\nthe cell at index 0 begins precisely at the start of the array, the cell at index 1 begins\\nprecisely cellsize bytes beyond the start of the array, and so on. As an example,\\ncell 4 of Figure 5.2 begins at memory location 2146 +2·4=2146 +8=2154.\\nOf course, the arithmetic for calculating memory addresses within an array can\\nbe handled automatically.

Low-Level Arrays 187\\n5.2.1 Referential Arrays\\nAs another motivating example, assume that we want a medical information system\\nto keep track of the patients currently assigned to beds in a certain hospital. If we\\nassume that the hospital has 200 beds, and conveniently that those beds are num-\\nbered from 0 to 199, we might consider using an array-based structure to maintainthe names of the patients currently assigned to those beds. For example, in Pythonwe might use a list of names, such as:\\n[\\nRene\\n ,\\nJoseph\\n ,\\nJanet\\n ,\\nJonas\\n ,\\nHelen\\n ,\\nVirginia\\n , ... ]\\nTo represent such a list with an array, Python must adhere to the requirement thateach cell of the array use the same number of bytes. Yet the elements are strings,and strings naturally have different lengths. Python could attempt to reserve enoughspace for each cell to hold the maximum length string (not just of currently stored\\nstrings, but of any string we might ever want to store), but that would be wasteful.\\nInstead, Python represents a list or tuple instance using an internal storage\\nmechanism of an array of object references . At the lowest level, what is stored\\nis a consecutive sequence of memory addresses at which the elements of the se-quence reside. A high-level diagram of such a list is shown in Figure 5.4.\\n0 3 12 5 4\\nRene\\n Virginia\\nJoseph\\n Helen\\nJonas\\n Janet\\nFigure 5.4: An array storing references to strings.\\nAlthough the relative size of the individual elements may vary, the number of\\nbits used to store the memory address of each element is ﬁxed (e.g., 64-bits peraddress). In this way, Python can support constant-time access to a list or tupleelement based on its index.\\nIn Figure 5.4, we characterize a list of strings that are the names of the patients\\nin a hospital. It is more likely that a medical information system would managemore comprehensive information on each patient, perhaps represented as an in-stance of a Patient class. From the perspective of the list implementation, the same\\nprinciple applies: The list will simply keep a sequence of references to those ob-jects. Note as well that a reference to the None object can be used as an element\\nof the list to represent an empty bed in the hospital.'),\n",

Array-Based Sequences\\nThe fact that lists and tuples are referential structures is signiﬁcant to the se-\\nmantics of these classes. A single list instance may include multiple references\\nto the same object as elements of the list, and it is possible for a single object tobe an element of two or more lists, as those lists simply store references back tothat object. As an example, when you compute a slice of a list, the result is a newlist instance, but that new list has references to the same elements that are in the\\noriginal list, as portrayed in Figure 5.5.\\n3 4 5 6 7 012012\\nprimes :temp :\\n31 1 5 21 9 17 13 7\\nFigure 5.5: The result of the command temp = primes[3:6] .\\nWhen the elements of the list are immutable objects, as with the integer in-\\nstances in Figure 5.5, the fact that the two lists share elements is not that signiﬁ-\\ncant, as neither of the lists can cause a change to the shared object.

Array-Based Sequences\\n5.2.2 Compact Arrays in Python\\nIn the introduction to this section, we emphasized that strings are represented using\\nan array of characters (not an array of references). We will refer to this more directrepresentation as a compact array because the array is storing the bits that represent\\nthe primary data (characters, in the case of strings).\\n0ASM P L E\\n345 12\\nCompact arrays have several advantages over referential structures in terms\\nof computing performance. Most signiﬁcantly, the overall memory usage will bemuch lower for a compact structure because there is no overhead devoted to the\\nexplicit storage of the sequence of memory references (in addition to the primary\\ndata). That is, a referential structure will typically use 64-bits for the memoryaddress stored in the array, on top of whatever number of bits are used to representthe object that is considered the element. Also, each Unicode character stored ina compact array within a string typically requires 2 bytes. If each character were\\nstored independently as a one-character string, there would be signiﬁcantly more\\nbytes used.\\nAs another case study, suppose we wish to store a sequence of one million,\\n64-bit integers. In theory, we might hope to use only 64 million bits. However, we\\nestimate that a Python list will use four to ﬁve times as much memory . Each element\\nof the list will result in a 64-bit memory address being stored in the primary array,\\nand an intinstance being stored elsewhere in memory. Python allows you to query\\nthe actual number of bytes being used for the primary storage of any object. Thisis done using the getsizeof function of the sysmodule. On our system, the size of\\na typical intobject requires 14 bytes of memory (well beyond the 4 bytes needed\\nfor representing the actual 64-bit number). In all, the list will be using 18 bytes perentry, rather than the 4 bytes that a compact list of integers would require.\\nAnother important advantage to a compact structure for high-performance com-\\nputing is that the primary data are stored consecutively in memory. Note well that\\nthis is not the case for a referential structure. That is, even though a list maintains\\ncareful ordering of the sequence of memory addresses, where those elements residein memory is not determined by the list. Because of the workings of the cache andmemory hierarchies of computers, it is often advantageous to have data stored in\\nmemory near other data that might be used in the same computations.\\nDespite the apparent inefﬁciencies of referential structures, we will generally\\nbe content with the convenience of Python’s lists and tuples in this book. The only\\nplace in which we consider alternatives will be in Chapter 15, which focuses onthe impact of memory usage on data structures and algorithms. Python provides\\nseveral means for creating compact arrays of various types.'),\n",

Array-Based Sequences\\n5.3 Dynamic Arrays and Amortization\\nWhen creating a low-level array in a computer system, the precise size of that array\\nmust be explicitly declared in order for the system to properly allocate a consecutivepiece of memory for its storage. For example, Figure 5.11 displays an array of 12bytes that might be stored in memory locations 2146 through 2157.\\n2160 21452146214721482149215021512152215321542155215621572158 2144 2159\\nFigure 5.11: An array of 12 bytes allocated in memory locations 2146 through 2157.\\nBecause the system might dedicate neighboring memory locations to store otherdata, the capacity of an array cannot trivially be increased by expanding into sub-sequent cells. In the context of representing a Python tuple orstrinstance, this\\nconstraint is no problem. Instances of those classes are immutable, so the correct\\nsize for an underlying array can be ﬁxed when the object is instantiated.\\nPython’s listclass presents a more interesting abstraction. Although a list has a\\nparticular length when constructed, the class allows us to add elements to the list,\\nwith no apparent limit on the overall capacity of the list. To provide this abstraction,\\nPython relies on an algorithmic sleight of hand known as a dynamic array .\\nThe ﬁrst key to providing the semantics of a dynamic array is that a list instance\\nmaintains an underlying array that often has greater capacity than the current lengthof the list. For example, while a user may have created a list with ﬁve elements,\\nthe system may have reserved an underlying array capable of storing eight objectreferences (rather than only ﬁve). This extra capacity makes it easy to append anew element to the list by using the next available cell of the array.\\nIf a user continues to append elements to a list, any reserved capacity will\\neventually be exhausted. In that case, the class requests a new, larger array from thesystem, and initializes the new array so that its preﬁx matches that of the existingsmaller array. At that point in time, the old array is no longer needed, so it is\\nreclaimed by the system. Intuitively, this strategy is much like that of the hermit\\ncrab, which moves into a larger shell when it outgrows its previous one.\\nWe give empirical evidence that Python’s listclass is based upon such a strat-\\negy. The source code for our experiment is displayed in Code Fragment 5.1, and asample output of that program is given in Code Fragment 5.2. We rely on a func-tion named getsizeof that is available from the sysmodule. This function reports\\nthe number of bytes that are being used to store an object in Python. For a list, itreports the number of bytes devoted to the array and other instance variables of the\\nlist, but notany space devoted to elements referenced by the list.'),\n",

Array-Based Sequences\\nIn evaluating the results of the experiment, we draw attention to the ﬁrst line of\\noutput from Code Fragment 5.2. We see that an empty list instance already requires\\na certain number of bytes of memory (72 on our system). In fact, each object inPython maintains some state, for example, a reference to denote the class to whichit belongs. Although we cannot directly access private instance variables for a list,we can speculate that in some form it maintains state information akin to:\\nnThe number of actual elements currently stored in the list.\\ncapacity The maximum number of elements that could be stored in thecurrently allocated array.\\nAThe reference to the currently allocated array (initially None ).\\nAs soon as the ﬁrst element is inserted into the list, we detect a change in the\\nunderlying size of the structure. In particular, we see the number of bytes jumpfrom 72 to 104, an increase of exactly 32 bytes. Our experiment was run on a64-bit machine architecture, meaning that each memory address is a 64-bit number(i.e., 8 bytes). We speculate that the increase of 32 bytes reﬂects the allocation of\\nan underlying array capable of storing four object references. This hypothesis is\\nconsistent with the fact that we do not see any underlying change in the memoryusage after inserting the second, third, or fourth element into the list.\\nAfter the ﬁfth element has been added to the list, we see the memory usage jump\\nfrom 104 bytes to 136 bytes. If we assume the original base usage of 72 bytes forthe list, the total of 136 suggests an additional 64 =8×8 bytes that provide capacity\\nfor up to eight object references. Again, this is consistent with the experiment, asthe memory usage does not increase again until the ninth insertion. At that point,the 200 bytes can be viewed as the original 72 plus an additional 128-byte array tostore 16 object references. The 17\\nthinsertion pushes the overall memory usage to\\n272 =72+200 =72+25×8, hence enough to store up to 25 element references.\\nBecause a list is a referential structure, the result of getsizeof for a list instance\\nonly includes the size for representing its primary structure; it does not account formemory used by the objects that are elements of the list. In our experiment, we\\nrepeatedly append None to the list, because we do not care about the contents, but\\nwe could append any type of object without affecting the number of bytes reported\\nbygetsizeof(data) .\\nIf we were to continue such an experiment for further iterations, we might try\\nto discern the pattern for how large of an array Python creates each time the ca-\\npacity of the previous array is exhausted (see Exercises R-5.2 and C-5.13). Beforeexploring the precise sequence of capacities used by Python, we continue in thissection by describing a general approach for implementing dynamic arrays and for\\nperforming an asymptotic analysis of their performance.'),\n",

Dynamic Arrays and Amortization 197\\n5.3.2 Amortized Analysis of Dynamic Arrays\\nIn this section, we perform a detailed analysis of the running time of operations on\\ndynamic arrays. We use the big-Omega notation introduced in Section 3.3.1 to givean asymptotic lower bound on the running time of an algorithm or step within it.\\nThe strategy of replacing an array with a new, larger array might at ﬁrst seem\\nslow, because a single append operation may require Ω(n)time to perform, where\\nnis the current number of elements in the array. However, notice that by doubling\\nthe capacity during an array replacement, our new array allows us to add nnew\\nelements before the array must be replaced again. In this way, there are manysimple append operations for each expensive one (see Figure 5.13). This fact allowsus to show that performing a series of operations on an initially empty dynamic\\narray is efﬁcient in terms of its total running time.\\nUsing an algorithmic design pattern called amortization , we can show that per-\\nforming a sequence of such append operations on a dynamic array is actually quite\\nefﬁcient. To perform an amortized analysis , we use an accounting technique where\\nwe view the computer as a coin-operated appliance that requires the payment of\\nonecyber-dollar for a constant amount of computing time. When an operation\\nis executed, we should have enough cyber-dollars available in our current “bank\\naccount” to pay for that operation’s running time. Thus, the total amount of cyber-dollars spent for any computation will be proportional to the total time spent on thatcomputation.

We shall charge each append\\noperation three cyber-dollars. Thus, we overcharge each append operation that doesnot cause an overﬂow by two cyber-dollars. Think of the two cyber-dollars proﬁted\\nin an insertion that does not grow the array as being “stored” with the cell in which\\nthe element was inserted. An overﬂow occurs when the array Shas 2\\nielements, for\\nsome integer i≥0, and the size of the array used by the array representing Sis 2i.\\nThus, doubling the size of the array will require 2icyber-dollars. Fortunately, these\\ncyber-dollars can be found stored in cells 2i−1through 2i−1.

Dynamic Arrays and Amortization 199\\nGeometric Increase in Capacity\\nAlthough the proof of Proposition 5.1 relies on the array being doubled each time\\nwe expand, the O(1)amortized bound per operation can be proven for any geo-\\nmetrically increasing progression of array sizes (see Section 2.4.2 for discussion ofgeometric progressions). When choosing the geometric base, there exists a trade-off between run-time efﬁciency and memory usage. With a base of 2 (i.e., doublingthe array), if the last insertion causes a resize event, the array essentially ends uptwice as large as it needs to be. If we instead increase the array by only 25% of\\nits current size (i.e., a geometric base of 1.25), we do not risk wasting as much\\nmemory in the end, but there will be more intermediate resize events along theway. Still it is possible to prove an O(1)amortized bound, using a constant factor\\ngreater than the 3 cyber-dollars per operation used in the proof of Proposition 5.1\\n(see Exercise C-5.15). The key to the performance is that the amount of additional\\nspace is proportional to the current size of the array.\\nBeware of Arithmetic Progression\\nTo avoid reserving too much space at once, it might be tempting to implement adynamic array with a strategy in which a constant number of additional cells arereserved each time an array is resized. Unfortunately, the overall performance of\\nsuch a strategy is signiﬁcantly worse. At an extreme, an increase of only one cell\\ncauses each append operation to resize the array, leading to a familiar 1 +2+3+\\n···+nsummation and Ω(n\\n2)overall cost.

Array-Based Sequences\\nUsing a ﬁxed increment for each resize, and thus an arithmetic progression of\\nintermediate array sizes, results in an overall time that is quadratic in the number\\nof operations, as shown in the following proposition. Intuitively, even an increasein 1000 cells per resize will become insigniﬁcant for large data sets.\\nProposition 5.2:\\nPerforming a series of nappend operations on an initially empty\\ndynamic array using a ﬁxed increment with each resize takes Ω(n2)time.\\nJustiﬁcation: Letc>0 represent the ﬁxed increment in capacity that is used for\\neach resize event.

That is, the data structure uses O(n)memory. This\\nis a very desirable property for a data structure.\\nIf a container, such as a Python list, provides operations that cause the removal\\nof one or more elements, greater care must be taken to ensure that a dynamic arrayguarantees O(n)memory usage. The risk is that repeated insertions may cause the\\nunderlying array to grow arbitrarily large, and that there will no longer be a propor-tional relationship between the actual number of elements and the array capacity\\nafter many elements are removed.\\nA robust implementation of such a data structure will shrink the underlying\\narray, on occasion, while maintaining the O(1)amortized bound on individual op-\\nerations. However, care must be taken to ensure that the structure cannot rapidlyoscillate between growing and shrinking the underlying array, in which case the\\namortized bound would not be achieved. In Exercise C-5.16, we explore a strategyin which the array capacity is halved whenever the number of actual element fallsbelow one fourth of that capacity, thereby guaranteeing that the array capacity is atmost four times the number of elements; we explore the amortized analysis of such\\na strategy in Exercises C-5.17 and C-5.18.'),\n",

Dynamic Arrays and Amortization 201\\n5.3.3 Python’s List Class\\nThe experiments of Code Fragment 5.1 and 5.2, at the beginning of Section 5.3,\\nprovide empirical evidence that Python’s listclass is using a form of dynamic arrays\\nfor its storage. Yet, a careful examination of the intermediate array capacities (see\\nExercises R-5.2 and C-5.13) suggests that Python is not using a pure geometric\\nprogression, nor is it using an arithmetic progression.\\nWith that said, it is clear that Python’s implementation of the append method\\nexhibits amortized constant-time behavior. We can demonstrate this fact experi-\\nmentally. A single append operation typically executes so quickly that it would be\\ndifﬁcult for us to accurately measure the time elapsed at that granularity, althoughwe should notice some of the more expensive operations in which a resize is per-formed. We can get a more accurate measure of the amortized cost per operationby performing a series of nappend operations on an initially empty list and deter-\\nmining the average cost of each.

We continue in this\\nsection by examining the performance of all of Python’s sequence types.\\n5.4.1 Python’s List and Tuple Classes\\nThenonmutating behaviors of the listclass are precisely those that are supported\\nby the tuple class. We note that tuples are typically more memory efﬁcient than\\nlists because they are immutable; therefore, there is no need for an underlying\\ndynamic array with surplus capacity. We summarize the asymptotic efﬁciency ofthe nonmutating behaviors of the listandtuple classes in Table 5.3.

Efﬁciency of Python’s Sequence Types 203\\nSearching for Occurrences of a Value\\nEach of the count ,index ,a n d\\n contains\\n methods proceed through iteration\\nof the sequence from left to right. In fact, Code Fragment 2.14 of Section 2.4.3\\ndemonstrates how those behaviors might be implemented. Notably, the loop for\\ncomputing the count must proceed through the entire sequence, while the loopsfor checking containment of an element or determining the index of an elementimmediately exit once they ﬁnd the leftmost occurrence of the desired value, ifone exists. So while count always examines the nelements of the sequence,\\nindex and\\ncontains\\n examine nelements in the worst case, but may be faster.\\nEmpirical evidence can be found by setting data = list(range(10000000)) and\\nthen comparing the relative efﬁciency of the test, 5indata, relative to the test,\\n9999995 indata,o re v e nt h ef a i l e dt e s t , −5indata.\\nLexicographic Comparisons\\nComparisons between two sequences are deﬁned lexicographically. In the worstcase, evaluating such a condition requires an iteration taking time proportionalto the length of the shorter of the two sequences (because when one sequence\\nends, the lexicographic result can be determined). However, in some cases the\\nresult of the test can be evaluated more efﬁciently. For example, if evaluating\\n[7, 3, ...] <[7, 5, ...] , it is clear that the result is True without examining the re-\\nmainders of those lists, because the second element of the left operand is strictlyless than the second element of the right operand.\\nCreating New Instances\\nThe ﬁnal three behaviors in Table 5.3 are those that construct a new instance basedon one or more existing instances. In all cases, the running time depends on theconstruction and initialization of the new result, and therefore the asymptotic be-havior is proportional to the length of the result. Therefore, we ﬁnd that slice\\ndata[6000000:6000008] can be constructed almost immediately because it has only\\neight elements, while slice data[6000000:7000000] has one million elements, and\\nthus is more time-consuming to create.\\nMutating Behaviors\\nThe efﬁciency of the mutating behaviors of the listclass are described in Table 5.3.\\nThe simplest of those behaviors has syntax data[j] = val , and is supported by the\\nspecial\\n setitem\\n method. This operation has worst-case O(1)running time be-\\ncause it simply replaces one element of a list with a new value. No other elementsare affected and the size of the underlying array does not change. The more inter-\\nesting behaviors to analyze are those that add or remove elements from the list.'),\n",

For the purpose of illustration, Code Fragment 5.5 pro-\\nvides an implementation of that method, in the context of our DynamicArray class\\nintroduced in Code Fragment 5.3. There are two complicating factors in analyzingthe efﬁciency of such an operation. First, we note that the addition of one element\\nmay require a resizing of the dynamic array. That portion of the work requires Ω(n)\\nworst-case time but only O(1)amortized time, as per append . The other expense\\nforinsert is the shifting of elements to make room for the new item.

Array-Based Sequences\\nRemoving Elements from a List\\nPython’s listclass offers several ways to remove an element from a list. A call to\\npop() removes the last element from a list. This is most efﬁcient, because all other\\nelements remain in their original location. This is effectively an O(1)operation,\\nbut the bound is amortized because Python will occasionally shrink the underlying\\ndynamic array to conserve memory.\\nThe parameterized version, pop(k) , removes the element that is at index k<n\\nof a list, shifting all subsequent elements leftward to ﬁll the gap that results from\\nthe removal. The efﬁciency of this operation is O(n−k), as the amount of shifting\\ndepends upon the choice of index k, as illustrated in Figure 5.17. Note well that this\\nimplies that pop(0) is the most expensive call, using Ω(n)time.

An implementation of such behavior is given\\nin Code Fragment 5.6, again using our DynamicArray class for illustration.\\nInterestingly, there is no “efﬁcient” case for remove ; every call requires Ω(n)\\ntime.

Efﬁciency of Python’s Sequence Types 207\\nExtending a List\\nPython provides a method named extend that is used to add all elements of one list\\nto the end of a second list. In effect, a call to data.extend(other) produces the same\\noutcome as the code,\\nforelement inother:\\ndata.append(element)\\nIn either case, the running time is proportional to the length of the other list, and\\namortized because the underlying array for the ﬁrst list may be resized to accom-\\nmodate the additional elements.\\nIn practice, the extend method is preferable to repeated calls to append because\\nthe constant factors hidden in the asymptotic analysis are signiﬁcantly smaller. The\\ngreater efﬁciency of extend is threefold. First, there is always some advantage to\\nusing an appropriate Python method, because those methods are often implementednatively in a compiled language (rather than as interpreted Python code). Second,there is less overhead to a single function call that accomplishes all the work, versusmany individual function calls. Finally, increased efﬁciency of extend comes from\\nthe fact that the resulting size of the updated list can be calculated in advance. If the\\nsecond data set is quite large, there is some risk that the underlying dynamic array\\nmight be resized multiple times when using repeated calls to append . With a single\\ncall to extend , at most one resize operation will be performed. Exercise C-5.22\\nexplores the relative efﬁciency of these two approaches experimentally.\\nConstructing New Lists\\nThere are several syntaxes for constructing new lists. In almost all cases, the asymp-totic efﬁciency of the behavior is linear in the length of the list that is created. How-\\never, as with the case in the preceding discussion of extend , there are signiﬁcant\\ndifferences in the practical efﬁciency.\\nSection 1.9.2 introduces the topic of list comprehension , using an example\\nsuch as squares = [ k\\nkforkinrange(1, n+1) ] as a shorthand for\\nsquares = [ ]\\nforkinrange(1, n+1):\\nsquares.append(k\\n k)\\nExperiments should show that the list comprehension syntax is signiﬁcantly fasterthan building the list by repeatedly appending (see Exercise C-5.23).\\nSimilarly, it is a common Python idiom to initialize a list of constant values\\nusing the multiplication operator, as in [0]\\nnto produce a list of length nwith\\nall values equal to zero. Not only is this succinct for the programmer; it is moreefﬁcient than building such a list incrementally.'),\n",

Array-Based Sequences\\n5.4.2 Python’s String Class\\nStrings are very important in Python. We introduced their use in Chapter 1, with\\na discussion of various operator syntaxes in Section 1.3. A comprehensive sum-mary of the named methods of the class is given in Tables A.1 through A.4 of\\nAppendix A. We will not formally analyze the efﬁciency of each of those behav-\\niors in this section, but we do wish to comment on some notable issues. In general,we let ndenote the length of a string. For operations that rely on a second string as\\na pattern, we let mdenote the length of that pattern string.\\nThe analysis for many behaviors is quite intuitive. For example, methods that\\nproduce a new string (e.g., capitalize ,center ,strip) require time that is linear in\\nthe length of the string that is produced. Many of the behaviors that test Booleanconditions of a string (e.g., islower )t a k e O(n)time, examining all ncharacters in the\\nworst case, but short circuiting as soon as the answer becomes evident (e.g., islower\\ncan immediately return False if the ﬁrst character is uppercased). The comparison\\noperators (e.g., ==,<) fall into this category as well.\\nPattern Matching\\nSome of the most interesting behaviors, from an algorithmic point of view, are thosethat in some way depend upon ﬁnding a string pattern within a larger string; this\\ngoal is at the heart of methods such as\\ncontains\\n ,ﬁnd,index ,count ,replace ,\\nandsplit. String algorithms will be the topic of Chapter 13, and this particular\\nproblem known as pattern matching will be the focus of Section 13.2. A naive im-\\nplementation runs in O(mn)time case, because we consider the n−m+1 possible\\nstarting indices for the pattern, and we spend O(m)time at each starting position,\\nchecking if the pattern matches. However, in Section 13.2, we will develop an al-\\ngorithm for ﬁnding a pattern of length mwithin a longer string of length ninO(n)\\ntime.\\nComposing Strings\\nFinally, we wish to comment on several approaches for composing large strings. Asan academic exercise, assume that we have a large string named document , and our\\ngoal is to produce a new string, letters , that contains only the alphabetic characters\\nof the original string (e.g., with spaces, numbers, and punctuation removed). It maybe tempting to compose a result through repeated concatenation, as follows.\\n# WARNING: do not do thisletters =\\n# start with empty string\\nforcindocument:\\nifc.isalpha():\\nletters += c # concatenate alphabetic character'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Michel T.Goodrich ,Roberto Tamassia, Michel H.Gold wasser, Data Structures and Algorithms in Python.pdf', 'page': 230}, page_content='5.4. Efﬁciency of Python’s Sequence Types 209\\nWhile the preceding code fragment accomplishes the goal, it may be terribly\\ninefﬁcient. Because strings are immutable, the command, letters += c , would\\npresumably compute the concatenation, letters + c , as a new string instance and\\nthen reassign the identiﬁer, letters , to that result. Constructing that new string\\nwould require time proportional to its length. If the ﬁnal result has ncharacters, the\\nseries of concatenations would take time proportional to the familiar sum 1 +2+\\n3+···+n, and therefore O(n2)time.\\nInefﬁcient code of this type is widespread in Python, perhaps because of the\\nsomewhat natural appearance of the code, and mistaken presumptions about how\\nthe+= operator is evaluated with strings. Some later implementations of the\\nPython interpreter have developed an optimization to allow such code to completein linear time, but this is not guaranteed for all Python implementations. The op-\\ntimization is as follows. The reason that a command, letters += c , causes a new\\nstring instance to be created is that the original string must be left unchanged if\\nanother variable in a program refers to that string. On the other hand, if Pythonknew that there were no other references to the string in question, it could imple-\\nment+=more efﬁciently by directly mutating the string (as a dynamic array). As\\nit happens, the Python interpreter already maintains what are known as reference\\ncounts for each object; this count is used in part to determine if an object can be\\ngarbage collected. (See Section 15.1.2.) But in this context, it provides a means to\\ndetect when no other references exist to a string, thereby allowing the optimization.\\nA more standard Python idiom to guarantee linear time composition of a string\\nis to use a temporary list to store individual pieces, and then to rely on the join\\nmethod of the strclass to compose the ﬁnal result. Using this technique with our\\nprevious example would appear as follows:\\ntemp = [ ] # start with empty list\\nforcindocument:\\nifc.isalpha():\\ntemp.append(c) # append alphabetic character\\nletters =\\n.join(temp) # compose overall result\\nThis approach is guaranteed to run in O(n)time. First, we note that the series of\\nup to nappend calls will require a total of O(n)time, as per the deﬁnition of the\\namortized cost of that operation. The ﬁnal call to joinalso guarantees that it takes\\ntime that is linear in the ﬁnal length of the composed string.\\nAs we discussed at the end of the previous section, we can further improve\\nthe practical execution time by using a list comprehension syntax to build up thetemporary list, rather than by repeated calls to append. That solution appears as,\\nletters =\\n.join([c forcindocument ifc.isalpha()])\\nBetter yet, we can entirely avoid the temporary list with a generator comprehension:\\nletters =\\n .join(c forcindocument ifc.isalpha())'),\n",

We could just as easily have chosen to store records for patients ina hospital or the names of players on a football team. Nevertheless, let us focus onstoring high score entries, which is a simple application that is already rich enoughto present some important data-structuring concepts.\\nTo begin, we consider what information to include in an object representing a\\nhigh score entry.

Using Array-Based Sequences 211\\nA Class for High Scores\\nTo maintain a sequence of high scores, we develop a class named Scoreboard .A\\nscoreboard is limited to a certain number of high scores that can be saved; once that\\nlimit is reached, a new score only qualiﬁes for the scoreboard if it is strictly higherthan the lowest “high score” on the board. The length of the desired scoreboard maydepend on the game, perhaps 10, 50, or 500. Since that limit may vary depending onthe game, we allow it to be speciﬁed as a parameter to our Scoreboard constructor.\\nInternally, we will use a Python listnamed\\nboard in order to manage the\\nGameEntry instances that represent the high scores. Since we expect the score-\\nboard to eventually reach full capacity, we initialize the list to be large enough tohold the maximum number of scores, but we initially set all entries to None .B y\\nallocating the list with maximum capacity initially, it never needs to be resized. Asentries are added, we will maintain them from highest to lowest score, starting atindex 0 of the list.

Using Array-Based Sequences 213\\nAdding an Entry\\nThe most interesting method of the Scoreboard class is add, which is responsible\\nfor considering the addition of a new entry to the scoreboard. Keep in mind that\\nevery entry will not necessarily qualify as a high score. If the board is not yet full,any new entry will be retained. Once the board is full, a new entry is only retained\\nif it is strictly better than one of the other scores, in particular, the last entry of the\\nscoreboard, which is the lowest of the high scores.\\nWhen a new score is considered, we begin by determining whether it qualiﬁes\\nas a high score. If so, we increase the count of active scores,\\nn, unless the board\\nis already at full capacity. In that case, adding a new high score causes some otherentry to be dropped from the scoreboard, so the overall number of entries remainsthe same.\\nTo correctly place a new entry within the list, the ﬁnal task is to shift any in-\\nferior scores one spot lower (with the least score being dropped entirely when thescoreboard is full). This process is quite similar to the implementation of the insert\\nmethod of the listclass, as described on pages 204–205. In the context of our score-\\nboard, there is no need to shift any None references that remain near the end of the\\narray, so the process can proceed as diagrammed in Figure 5.19.\\n01 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2Mike 1105Rob 750\\nPaul 720 Rose 590Anna 660 Jack 510740 Jill\\nFigure 5.19: Adding a new GameEntry for Jill to the scoreboard.

Array-Based Sequences\\n5.5.2 Sorting a Sequence\\nIn the previous subsection, we considered an application for which we added an ob-\\nject to a sequence at a given position while shifting other elements so as to keep theprevious order intact. In this section, we use a similar technique to solve the sorting\\nproblem, that is, starting with an unordered sequence of elements and rearrangingthem into nondecreasing order.\\nThe Insertion-Sort Algorithm\\nWe study several sorting algorithms in this book, most of which are described inChapter 12. As a warm-up, in this section we describe a nice, simple sorting al-\\ngorithm known as insertion-sort . The algorithm proceeds as follows for an array-\\nbased sequence. We start with the ﬁrst element in the array. One element by itself\\nis already sorted. Then we consider the next element in the array. If it is smallerthan the ﬁrst, we swap them. Next we consider the third element in the array. Weswap it leftward until it is in its proper order with the ﬁrst two elements. We then\\nconsider the fourth element, and swap it leftward until it is in the proper order with\\nthe ﬁrst three. We continue in this manner with the ﬁfth element, the sixth, and soon, until the whole array is sorted. We can express the insertion-sort algorithm inpseudo-code, as shown in Code Fragment 5.9.\\nAlgorithm InsertionSort(A) :\\nInput: An array Aofncomparable elements\\nOutput: The array Awith elements rearranged in nondecreasing order\\nforkfrom1ton−1do\\nInsert A[k] at its proper location within A[0],A[1],...,A[k].\\nCode Fragment 5.9: High-level description of the insertion-sort algorithm.\\nThis is a simple, high-level description of insertion-sort. If we look back to\\nCode Fragment 5.8 of Section 5.5.1, we see that the task of inserting a new en-\\ntry into the list of high scores is almost identical to the task of inserting a newly\\nconsidered element in insertion-sort (except that game scores were ordered from\\nhigh to low). We provide a Python implementation of insertion-sort in Code Frag-ment 5.10, using an outer loop to consider each element in turn, and an innerloop that moves a newly considered element to its proper location relative to the\\n(sorted) subarray of elements that are to its left. We illustrate an example run of the\\ninsertion-sort algorithm in Figure 5.20.\\nThe nested loops of insertion-sort lead to an O(n\\n2)running time in the worst\\ncase. The most work is done if the array is initially in reverse order. On the otherhand, if the initial array is nearly sorted or perfectly sorted, insertion-sort runs in\\nO(n)time because there are few or no iterations of the inner loop.'),\n",

Array-Based Sequences\\n5.5.3 Simple Cryptography\\nAn interesting application of strings and lists is cryptography , the science of secret\\nmessages and their applications. This ﬁeld studies ways of performing encryp-\\ntion, which takes a message, called the plaintext , and converts it into a scrambled\\nmessage, called the ciphertext . Likewise, cryptography also studies corresponding\\nways of performing decryption , which takes a ciphertext and turns it back into its\\noriginal plaintext.\\nArguably the earliest encryption scheme is the Caesar cipher , which is named\\nafter Julius Caesar, who used this scheme to protect important military messages.\\n(All of Caesar’s messages were written in Latin, of course, which already makesthem unreadable for most of us!) The Caesar cipher is a simple way to obscure amessage written in a language that forms words with an alphabet.\\nThe Caesar cipher involves replacing each letter in a message with the letter that\\nis a certain number of letters after it in the alphabet. So, in an English message, wemight replace each A with D, each B with E, each C with F, and so on, if shifting bythree characters. We continue this approach all the way up to W, which is replacedwith Z. Then, we let the substitution pattern wrap around , so that we replace X\\nwith A, Y with B, and Z with C.\\nConverting Between Strings and Character Lists\\nGiven that strings are immutable, we cannot directly edit an instance to encrypt it.Instead, our goal will be to generate a new string. A convenient technique for per-forming string transformations is to create an equivalent list of characters, edit the\\nlist, and then reassemble a (new) string based on the list. The ﬁrst step can be per-\\nformed by sending the string as a parameter to the constructor of the listclass. For\\nexample, the expression list(\\nbird\\n )produces the result [\\nb\\n,\\ni\\n,\\nr\\n,\\nd\\n].\\nConversely, we can use a list of characters to build a string by invoking the join\\nmethod on an empty string, with the list of characters as the parameter. For exam-\\nple, the call\\n .join([\\n b\\n,\\ni\\n,\\nr\\n,\\nd\\n])returns the string\\n bird\\n .\\nUsing Characters as Array Indices\\nIf we were to number our letters like array indices, so that A is 0, B is 1, C is 2,\\nand so on, then we can write the Caesar cipher with a rotation of ras a simple\\nformula: Replace each letter iwith the letter (i+r)mod 26, where mod is the\\nmodulo operator, which returns the remainder after performing an integer division.\\nThis operator is denoted with %in Python, and it is exactly the operator we need\\nto easily perform the wrap around at the end of the alphabet. For 26 mod 26 is0, 27 mod 26 is 1, and 28 mod 26 is 2. The decryption algorithm for the Caesarcipher is just the opposite—we replace each letter with the one rplaces before it,\\nwith wrap around (that is, letter iis replaced by letter (i−r)mod 26).'),\n",

Using Array-Based Sequences 217\\nWe can represent a replacement rule using another string to describe the trans-\\nlation. As a concrete example, suppose we are using a Caesar cipher with a three-\\ncharacter rotation. We can precompute a string that represents the replacementsthat should be used for each character from A to Z. For example, A should be re-placed by D, B replaced by E, and so on. The 26 replacement characters in orderare\\nDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABC\\n . We can subsequently use this translation\\nstring as a guide to encrypt a message. The remaining challenge is how to quicklylocate the replacement for each character of the original message.\\nFortunately, we can rely on the fact that characters are represented in Unicode\\nby integer code points, and the code points for the uppercase letters of the Latin\\nalphabet are consecutive (for simplicity, we restrict our encryption to uppercase\\nletters). Python supports functions that convert between integer code points andone-character strings. Speciﬁcally, the function ord(c) takes a one-character string\\nas a parameter and returns the integer code point for that character. Conversely, thefunction chr(j) takes an integer and returns its associated one-character string.\\nIn order to ﬁnd a replacement for a character in our Caesar cipher, we need to\\nmap the characters\\nA\\nto\\nZ\\nto the respective numbers 0 to 25. The formula for\\ndoing that conversion is j=o r d ( c ) −ord(\\n A\\n). As a sanity check, if character c\\nis\\nA\\n,w eh a v et h a t j=0. When cis\\nB\\n, we will ﬁnd that its ordinal value is pre-\\ncisely one more than that for\\n A\\n, so their difference is 1. In general, the integer j\\nthat results from such a calculation can be used as an index into our precomputedtranslation string, as illustrated in Figure 5.21.\\n10 24 23 22 21 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 1125 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0M OPQRSTUV W XYZABC DEFGH I JKL N\\nHere is the\\nreplacement for\\n T\\nord(\\n T\\n)−ord(\\n A\\n)\\n84 − 65\\n19 ==In UnicodeUsing\\n T\\nas an indexencoder array\\nFigure 5.21: Illustrating the use of uppercase characters as indices, in this case to\\nperform the replacement rule for Caesar cipher encryption.\\nIn Code Fragment 5.11, we develop a Python class for performing the Caesar\\ncipher with an arbitrary rotational shift, and demonstrate its use.

Many computer applications involve mul-tidimensional data sets. For example, computer graphics are often modeled in\\neither two or three dimensions. Geographic information may be naturally repre-\\nsented in two dimensions, medical imaging may provide three-dimensional scansof a patient, and a company’s valuation is often based upon a high number of in-dependent ﬁnancial measures that can be modeled as multidimensional data. Atwo-dimensional array is sometimes also called a matrix . We may use two indices,\\nsayiand j, to refer to the cells in the matrix. The ﬁrst index usually refers to a\\nrow number and the second to a column number, and these are traditionally zero-indexed in computer science. Figure 5.22 illustrates a two-dimensional data setwith integer values. This data might, for example, represent the number of stores\\nin various regions of Manhattan.\\n22 18 709 5 33 10 4 56 82 440\\n45 32 830 120 750 660 13 77 20 105\\n4 880 45 66 61 28 650 7 510 67\\n940 12 36 3 20 100 306 590 0 500\\n50 65 42 49 88 25 70 126 83 288\\n398 233 5 83 59 232 49 8 365 90\\n33 58 632 87 94 5 59 204 120 82962 394 3 4 102 140 183 390 16 268\\n0\\n1\\n234\\n5\\n6701234567 9\\nFigure 5.22: Illustration of a two-dimensional integer data set, which has 8 rows\\nand 10 columns.

If our\\ngoal were to create the equivalent of a two-dimensional list of integers, with rrows\\nandccolumns, and to initialize all values to zero, a ﬂawed approach might be to\\ntry the command\\ndata = ([0]\\n c)\\nr # Warning: this is a mistake\\nWhile([0]\\n c)is indeed a list of czeros, multiplying that list by runfortunately cre-\\nates a single list with length r·c,j u s ta s [2,4,6]\\n 2results in list [ 2 ,4 ,6 ,2 ,4 ,6 ] .\\nA better, yet still ﬂawed attempt is to make a list that contains the list of czeros\\nas its only element, and then to multiply that list by r.

Stacks 229\\n6.1 Stacks\\nAstack is a collection of objects that are inserted and removed according to the\\nlast-in, ﬁrst-out (LIFO ) principle. A user may insert objects into a stack at any\\ntime, but may only access or remove the most recently inserted object that remains\\n(at the so-called “top” of the stack). The name “stack” is derived from the metaphorof a stack of plates in a spring-loaded, cafeteria plate dispenser. In this case, thefundamental operations involve the “pushing” and “popping” of plates on the stack.\\nWhen we need a new plate from the dispenser, we “pop” the top plate off the stack,\\nand when we add a plate, we “push” it down on the stack to become the new topplate. Perhaps an even more amusing example is a PEZ\\n®candy dispenser, which\\nstores mint candies in a spring-loaded container that “pops” out the topmost candyin the stack when the top of the dispenser is lifted (see Figure 6.1). Stacks are\\na fundamental data structure. They are used in many applications, including the\\nfollowing.\\nExample 6.1:\\nInternet Web browsers store the addresses of recently visited sites\\nin a stack. Each time a user visits a new site, that site’s address is “pushed” onto the\\nstack of addresses. The browser then allows the user to “pop” back to previously\\nvisited sites using the “back” button.\\nExample 6.2: Text editors usually provide an “undo” mechanism that cancels re-\\ncent editing operations and reverts to former states of a document. This undo oper-\\nation can be accomplished by keeping text changes in a stack.\\nFigure 6.1: A schematic drawing of a PEZ®dispenser; a physical implementation\\nof the stack ADT.

Stacks, Queues, and Deques\\n6.1.1 The Stack Abstract Data Type\\nStacks are the simplest of all data structures, yet they are also among the most\\nimportant. They are used in a host of different applications, and as a tool for manymore sophisticated data structures and algorithms. Formally, a stack is an abstract\\ndata type (ADT) such that an instance Ssupports the following two methods:\\nS.push(e) :Add element eto the top of stack S.\\nS.pop() :Remove and return the top element from the stack S;\\nan error occurs if the stack is empty.\\nAdditionally, let us deﬁne the following accessor methods for convenience:\\nS.top() :Return a reference to the top element of stack S, without\\nremoving it; an error occurs if the stack is empty.\\nS.is\\nempty() :Return True if stack Sdoes not contain any elements.\\nlen(S): Return the number of elements in stack S; in Python, we\\nimplement this with the special method\\n len\\n .\\nBy convention, we assume that a newly created stack is empty, and that there is no\\na priori bound on the capacity of the stack. Elements added to the stack can havearbitrary type.\\nExample 6.3:\\nThe following table shows a series of stack operations and their\\neffects on an initially empty stack Sof integers.\\nOperation\\n Return Value\\n Stack Contents\\nS.push(5)\\n –\\n [5]\\nS.push(3)\\n –\\n [5, 3]\\nlen(S)\\n 2\\n [5, 3]\\nS.pop()\\n 3\\n [5]\\nS.is\\nempty()\\n False\\n [5]\\nS.pop()\\n 5\\n []\\nS.is\\nempty()\\n True\\n []\\nS.pop()\\n “error”\\n []\\nS.push(7)\\n –\\n [7]\\nS.push(9)\\n –\\n [7, 9]\\nS.top()\\n 9\\n [7, 9]\\nS.push(4)\\n –\\n [7, 9, 4]\\nlen(S)\\n 3\\n [7, 9, 4]\\nS.pop()\\n 4\\n [7, 9]\\nS.push(6)\\n –\\n [7, 9, 6]\\nS.push(8)\\n –\\n [ 7 ,9 ,6 ,8 ]\\nS.pop()\\n 8\\n [7, 9, 6]\\n'),\n",

Stacks 231\\n6.1.2 Simple Array-Based Stack Implementation\\nWe can implement a stack quite easily by storing its elements in a Python list. The\\nlistclass already supports adding an element to the end with the append method,\\nand removing the last element with the popmethod, so it is natural to align the top\\nof the stack at the end of the list, as shown in Figure 6.2.\\n0M BCDEFG KLA\\n1 2 top\\nFigure 6.2: Implementing a stack with a Python list, storing the top element in the\\nrightmost cell.\\nAlthough a programmer could directly use the listclass in place of a formal\\nstack class, lists also include behaviors (e.g., adding or removing elements fromarbitrary positions) that would break the abstraction that the stack ADT represents.\\nAlso, the terminology used by the listclass does not precisely align with traditional\\nnomenclature for a stack ADT, in particular the distinction between append and\\npush . Instead, we demonstrate how to use a list for internal storage while providing\\na public interface consistent with a stack.\\nThe Adapter Pattern\\nThe adapter design pattern applies to any context where we effectively want to\\nmodify an existing class so that its methods match those of a related, but different,\\nclass or interface. One general way to apply the adapter pattern is to deﬁne a new\\nclass in such a way that it contains an instance of the existing class as a hiddenﬁeld, and then to implement each method of the new class using methods of thishidden instance variable. By applying the adapter pattern in this way, we havecreated a new class that performs some of the same functions as an existing class,\\nbut repackaged in a more convenient way. In the context of the stack ADT, we can\\nadapt Python’s list class using the correspondences shown in Table 6.1.\\nStack Method\\n Realization with Python list\\nS.push(e)\\n L.append(e)\\nS.pop()\\n L.pop()\\nS.top()\\n L[−1]\\nS.is\\nempty()\\n len(L) == 0\\nlen(S)\\n len(L)\\nTable 6.1: Realization of a stack Sas an adaptation of a Python list L.'),\n",

Stacks, Queues, and Deques\\nImplementing a Stack Using a Python List\\nWe use the adapter design pattern to deﬁne an ArrayStack class that uses an un-\\nderlying Python list for storage. (We choose the name ArrayStack to emphasize\\nthat the underlying storage is inherently array based.) One question that remains is\\nwhat our code should do if a user calls pop ortopwhen the stack is empty. Our\\nADT suggests that an error occurs, but we must decide what type of error. Whenpopis called on an empty Python list, it formally raises an IndexError , as lists are\\nindex-based sequences. That choice does not seem appropriate for a stack, sincethere is no assumption of indices. Instead, we can deﬁne a new exception class thatis more appropriate. Code Fragment 6.1 deﬁnes such an Empty class as a trivial\\nsubclass of the Python Exception class.\\nclassEmpty(Exception):\\n”””Error attempting to access an element from an empty container.”””\\npass\\nCode Fragment 6.1: Deﬁnition for an Empty exception class.\\nThe formal deﬁnition for our ArrayStack class is given in Code Fragment 6.2.\\nThe constructor establishes the member self.\\ndata as an initially empty Python list,\\nfor internal storage. The rest of the public stack behaviors are implemented, using\\nthe corresponding adaptation that was outlined in Table 6.1.\\nExample Usage\\nBelow, we present an example of the use of our ArrayStack class, mirroring the\\noperations at the beginning of Example 6.3 on page 230.\\nS = ArrayStack( ) #c o n t e n t s :[]\\nS.push(5) #c o n t e n t s :[ 5 ]\\nS.push(3) #c o n t e n t s :[ 5 ,3 ]\\nprint(len(S)) # contents: [5, 3]; outputs 2\\nprint(S.pop()) # contents: [5]; outputs 3\\nprint(S.is\\n empty()) # contents: [5]; outputs False\\nprint(S.pop()) # contents: [ ]; outputs 5\\nprint(S.is\\n empty()) # contents: [ ]; outputs True\\nS.push(7) #c o n t e n t s :[ 7 ]\\nS.push(9) #c o n t e n t s :[ 7 ,9 ]\\nprint(S.top()) # contents: [7, 9]; outputs 9\\nS.push(4) #c o n t e n t s :[ 7 ,9 ,4 ]\\nprint(len(S)) # contents: [7, 9, 4]; outputs 3\\nprint(S.pop()) # contents: [7, 9]; outputs 4\\nS.push(6) #c o n t e n t s :[ 7 ,9 ,6 ]'),\n",

In the analysis of lists from\\nSection 5.4.1, we emphasized that it is more efﬁcient in practice to construct a listwith initial length nthan it is to start with an empty list and append nitems (even\\nthough both approaches run in O(n)time).\\nAs an alternate model for a stack, we might wish for the constructor to accept\\na parameter specifying the maximum capacity of a stack and to initialize the\\ndata\\nmember to a list of that length. Implementing such a model requires signiﬁcantchanges relative to Code Fragment 6.2. The size of the stack would no longer besynonymous with the length of the list, and pushes and pops of the stack would notrequire changing the length of the list. Instead, we suggest maintaining a separateinteger as an instance variable that denotes the current number of elements in the\\nstack.

Stacks 235\\n6.1.3 Reversing Data Using a Stack\\nAs a consequence of the LIFO protocol, a stack can be used as a general tool to\\nreverse a data sequence. For example, if the values 1, 2, and 3 are pushed onto astack in that order, they will be popped from the stack in the order 3, 2, and then 1.\\nThis idea can be applied in a variety of settings. For example, we might wish\\nto print lines of a ﬁle in reverse order in order to display a data set in decreasingorder rather than increasing order. This can be accomplished by reading each lineand pushing it onto a stack, and then writing the lines in the order they are popped.\\nAn implementation of such a process is given in Code Fragment 6.3.\\n1defreverse\\nﬁle(ﬁlename):\\n2”””Overwrite given ﬁle with its contents line-by-line reversed.”””\\n3S = ArrayStack()\\n4original = open(ﬁlename)\\n5forlineinoriginal:\\n6 S.push(line.rstrip(\\n \\\\n\\n)) # we will re-insert newlines when writing\\n7original.close()\\n8\\n9# now we overwrite with contents in LIFO order\\n10 output = open(ﬁlename,\\n w\\n)# reopening ﬁle overwrites original\\n11while not S.is\\nempty():\\n12 output.write(S.pop( ) +\\n \\\\n\\n)# re-insert newline characters\\n13 output.close()\\nCode Fragment 6.3: A function that reverses the order of lines in a ﬁle.\\nOne technical detail worth noting is that we intentionally strip trailing newlines\\nfrom lines as they are read, and then re-insert newlines after each line when writing\\nthe resulting ﬁle. Our reason for doing this is to handle a special case in which the\\noriginal ﬁle does not have a trailing newline for the ﬁnal line. If we exactly echoedthe lines read from the ﬁle in reverse order, then the original last line would be fol-lowed (without newline) by the original second-to-last line. In our implementation,\\nwe ensure that there will be a separating newline in the result.\\nThe idea of using a stack to reverse a data set can be applied to other types of\\nsequences. For example, Exercise R-6.5 explores the use of a stack to provide yet\\nanother solution for reversing the contents of a Python list (a recursive solution forthis goal was discussed in Section 4.4.1). A more challenging task is to reverse\\nthe order in which elements are stored within a stack. If we were to move them\\nfrom one stack to another, they would be reversed, but if we were to then replacethem into the original stack, they would be reversed again, thereby reverting to theiroriginal order. Exercise C-6.18 explores a solution for this task.'),\n",

Thisrestriction enforces the rule that items are inserted and deleted in a queue accord-\\ning to the ﬁrst-in, ﬁrst-out (FIFO) principle. The queue abstract data type (ADT)\\nsupports the following two fundamental methods for a queue Q:\\nQ.enqueue(e) :Add element eto the back of queue Q.\\nQ.dequeue() :Remove and return the ﬁrst element from queue Q;\\nan error occurs if the queue is empty.\\nThe queue ADT also includes the following supporting methods (with ﬁrst being\\nanalogous to the stack’s topmethod):\\nQ.ﬁrst() :Return a reference to the element at the front of queue Q,\\nwithout removing it; an error occurs if the queue is empty.\\nQ.is\\nempty() :Return True if queue Qdoes not contain any elements.\\nlen(Q): Return the number of elements in queue Q; in Python,\\nwe implement this with the special method\\n len\\n .\\nBy convention, we assume that a newly created queue is empty, and that there\\nis no a priori bound on the capacity of the queue.

Queues 241\\n6.2.2 Array-Based Queue Implementation\\nFor the stack ADT, we created a very simple adapter class that used a Python list\\nas the underlying storage. It may be very tempting to use a similar approach forsupporting the queue ADT. We could enqueue element eby calling append(e) to\\nadd it to the end of the list. We could use the syntax pop(0) , as opposed to pop() ,\\nto intentionally remove the ﬁrstelement from the list when dequeuing.\\nAs easy as this would be to implement, it is tragically inefﬁcient. As we dis-\\ncussed in Section 5.4.1, when pop is called on a list with a non-default index, a\\nloop is executed to shift all elements beyond the speciﬁed index to the left, so as to\\nﬁll the hole in the sequence caused by the pop. Therefore, a call to pop(0) always\\ncauses the worst-case behavior of Θ(n)time.\\nWe can improve on the above strategy by avoiding the call to pop(0) entirely.\\nWe can replace the dequeued entry in the array with a reference to None ,a n dm a i n -\\ntain an explicit variable fto store the index of the element that is currently at the\\nfront of the queue. Such an algorithm for dequeue would run in O(1)time. After\\nseveral dequeue operations, this approach might lead to the conﬁguration portrayed\\nin Figure 6.5.\\n0EFG KL M\\n12 f\\nFigure 6.5: Allowing the front of the queue to drift away from index 0.\\nUnfortunately, there remains a drawback to the revised approach. In the case\\nof a stack, the length of the list was precisely equal to the size of the stack (even if\\nthe underlying array for the list was slightly larger). With the queue design that weare considering, the situation is worse. We can build a queue that has relatively few\\nelements, yet which are stored in an arbitrarily large list. This occurs, for example,\\nif we repeatedly enqueue a new element and then dequeue another (allowing thefront to drift rightward). Over time, the size of the underlying list would grow toO(m)where mis the total number of enqueue operations since the creation of the\\nqueue, rather than the current number of elements in the queue.\\nThis design would have detrimental consequences in applications in which\\nqueues have relatively modest size, but which are used for long periods of time.For example, the wait-list for a restaurant might never have more than 30 entriesat one time, but over the course of a day (or a week), the overall number of entries\\nwould be signiﬁcantly larger.'),\n",

Stacks, Queues, and Deques\\nUsing an Array Circularly\\nIn developing a more robust queue implementation, we allow the front of the queue\\nto drift rightward, and we allow the contents of the queue to “wrap around” the end\\nof an underlying array. We assume that our underlying array has ﬁxed length N\\nthat is greater that the actual number of elements in the queue. New elementsare enqueued toward the “end” of the current queue, progressing from the front to\\nindex N−1 and continuing at index 0, then 1. Figure 6.6 illustrates such a queue\\nwith ﬁrst element Eand last element M.\\n0MF GH IJ K L E\\n12 f N−1\\nFigure 6.6: Modeling a queue with a circular array that wraps around the end.\\nImplementing this circular view is not difﬁcult. When we dequeue an element\\nand want to “advance” the front index, we use the arithmetic f=( f+1 )%N .R e -\\nc a l lt h a tt h e %operator in Python denotes the modulo operator, which is computed\\nby taking the remainder after an integral division. For example, 14divided by 3has\\na quotient of 4with remainder 2,t h a ti s ,14\\n3=42\\n3. So in Python, 14 // 3 evaluates\\nto the quotient 4, while 14 % 3 evaluates to the remainder 2. The modulo operator\\nis ideal for treating an array circularly. As a concrete example, if we have a list\\nof length 10, and a front index 7, we can advance the front by formally computing(7+1) % 10 , which is simply 8, as 8 divided by 10 is 0 with a remainder of 8.\\nSimilarly, advancing index 8 results in index 9. But when we advance from index 9(the last one in the array), we compute (9+1) % 10 , which evaluates to index 0 (as\\n10 divided by 10 has a remainder of zero).\\nA Python Queue Implementation\\nA complete implementation of a queue ADT using a Python list in circular fashionis presented in Code Fragments 6.6 and 6.7.

Queues 245\\nWhen the dequeue method is called, the current value of self.\\nfront designates\\nthe index of the value that is to be removed and returned. We keep a local refer-\\nence to the element that will be returned, setting answer = self.\\n data[self.\\n front]\\njust prior to removing the reference to that object from the list, with the assignmentself.\\ndata[self.\\n front] = None . Our reason for the assignment to None relates to\\nPython’s mechanism for reclaiming unused space. Internally, Python maintains a\\ncount of the number of references that exist to each object. If that count reaches\\nzero, the object is effectively inaccessible, thus the system may reclaim that mem-ory for future use. (For more details, see Section 15.1.2.) Since we are no longerresponsible for storing a dequeued element, we remove the reference to it from our\\nlist so as to reduce that element’s reference count.\\nThe second signiﬁcant responsibility of the dequeue method is to update the\\nvalue of\\nfront to reﬂect the removal of the element, and the presumed promotion\\nof the second element to become the new ﬁrst. In most cases, we simply want\\nto increment the index by one, but because of the possibility of a wrap-around\\nconﬁguration, we rely on modular arithmetic as originally described on page 242.\\nResizing the Queue\\nWhen enqueue is called at a time when the size of the queue equals the size of the\\nunderlying list, we rely on a standard technique of doubling the storage capacity of\\nthe underlying list. In this way, our approach is similar to the one used when we\\nimplemented a DynamicArray in Section 5.3.1.\\nHowever, more care is needed in the queue’s\\n resize utility than was needed in\\nthe corresponding method of the DynamicArray class. After creating a temporary\\nreference to the old list of values, we allocate a new list that is twice the size and\\ncopy references from the old list to the new list. While transferring the contents, we\\nintentionally realign the front of the queue with index 0 in the new array, as shown\\nin Figure 6.7. This realignment is not purely cosmetic. Since the modular arith-metic depends on the size of the array, our state would be ﬂawed had we transferredeach element to its same index in the new array.\\nEG H IJ K\\nEFG HI JKFf\\n12 f=0\\nFigure 6.7: Resizing the queue, while realigning the front element with index 0.'),\n",

As a\\nconsequence, the capacity of the underlying array is proportional to the maximumnumber of elements that have ever been stored in the queue, not the current numberof elements.\\nWe discussed this very issue on page 200, in the context of dynamic arrays, and\\nin subsequent Exercises C-5.16 through C-5.20 of that chapter. A robust approachis to reduce the array to half of its current size, whenever the number of elementsstored in it falls below one fourth of its capacity.

Double-Ended Queues 247\\n6.3 Double-Ended Queues\\nWe next consider a queue-like data structure that supports insertion and deletion\\nat both the front and the back of the queue. Such a structure is called a double-\\nended queue ,o rdeque , which is usually pronounced “deck” to avoid confusion\\nwith the dequeue method of the regular queue ADT, which is pronounced like the\\nabbreviation “D.Q.”\\nThe deque abstract data type is more general than both the stack and the queue\\nADTs. The extra generality can be useful in some applications. For example, wedescribed a restaurant using a queue to maintain a waitlist. Occassionally, the ﬁrstperson might be removed from the queue only to ﬁnd that a table was not available;typically, the restaurant will re-insert the person at the ﬁrstposition in the queue. It\\nmay also be that a customer at the end of the queue may grow impatient and leave\\nthe restaurant. (We will need an even more general data structure if we want to\\nmodel customers leaving the queue from other positions.)\\n6.3.1 The Deque Abstract Data Type\\nTo provide a symmetrical abstraction, the deque ADT is deﬁned so that deque D\\nsupports the following methods:\\nD.add\\n ﬁrst(e) :Add element eto the front of deque D.\\nD.add\\n last(e) :Add element eto the back of deque D.\\nD.delete\\n ﬁrst(): Remove and return the ﬁrst element from deque D;\\nan error occurs if the deque is empty.\\nD.delete\\n last() :Remove and return the last element from deque D;\\nan error occurs if the deque is empty.\\nAdditionally, the deque ADT will include the following accessors:\\nD.ﬁrst() :Return (but do not remove) the ﬁrst element of deque D;\\nan error occurs if the deque is empty.\\nD.last() :Return (but do not remove) the last element of deque D;\\nan error occurs if the deque is empty.\\nD.is\\nempty() :Return True if deque Ddoes not contain any elements.\\nlen(D): Return the number of elements in deque D; in Python,\\nwe implement this with the special method\\n len\\n .'),\n",

We recommend\\nmaintaining the same three instance variables:\\n data,\\nsize,a n d\\n front . Whenever\\nwe need to know the index of the back of the deque, or the ﬁrst available slotbeyond the back of the deque, we use modular arithmetic for the computation.

One subtlety is that a call to add\\nﬁrst may need to wrap around the\\nbeginning of the array, so we rely on modular arithmetic to circularly decrement\\nthe index, as\\nself.\\nfront = (self.\\n front−1) % len(self.\\n data) # cyclic shift\\nThe efﬁciency of an ArrayDeque i ss i m i l a rt ot h a to fa n ArrayQueue, with all\\noperations having O(1)running time, but with that bound being amortized for op-\\nerations that may change the size of the underlying list.'),\n",

Therefore, appendleft andpopleft designate an opera-\\ntion at the beginning of the list. The library deque also mimics a list in that it is an\\nindexed sequence, allowing arbitrary access or modiﬁcation using the D[j]syntax.\\nThe library deque constructor also supports an optional maxlen parameter to\\nforce a ﬁxed-length deque. However, if a call to append at either end is invoked\\nwhen the deque is full, it does not throw an error; instead, it causes one element tobe dropped from the opposite side. That is, calling appendleft when the deque is\\nfull causes an implicit popfrom the right side to make room for the new element.\\nThe current Python distribution implements collections.deque with a hybrid ap-\\nproach that uses aspects of circular arrays, but organized into blocks that are them-selves organized in a doubly linked list (a data structure that we will introduce inthe next chapter). The deque class is formally documented to guarantee O(1)-time\\noperations at either end, but O(n)-time worst-case operations when using index\\nnotation near the middle of the deque.'),\n",

Stacks, Queues, and Deques\\nP-6.36 When a share of common stock of some company is sold, the capital\\ngain (or, sometimes, loss) is the difference between the share’s selling\\nprice and the price originally paid to buy it. This rule is easy to under-\\nstand for a single share, but if we sell multiple shares of stock boughtover a long period of time, then we must identify the shares actually be-ing sold. A standard accounting principle for identifying which shares of\\na stock were sold in such a case is to use a FIFO protocol—the shares\\nsold are the ones that have been held the longest (indeed, this is the de-fault method built into several personal ﬁnance software packages). Forexample, suppose we buy 100 shares at $20 each on day 1, 20 shares at\\n$24 on day 2, 200 shares at $36 on day 3, and then sell 150 shares on day\\n4 at $30 each. Then applying the FIFO protocol means that of the 150shares sold, 100 were bought on day 1, 20 were bought on day 2, and 30were bought on day 3. The capital gain in this case would therefore be100·10+20·6+30·(−6), or $940.

Linked Lists\\nIn Chapter 5 we carefully examined Python’s array-based listclass, and in\\nChapter 6 we demonstrated use of that class in implementing the classic stack,\\nqueue, and dequeue ADTs. Python’s listclass is highly optimized, and often a\\ngreat choice for storage. With that said, there are some notable disadvantages:\\n1. The length of a dynamic array might be longer than the actual number of\\nelements that it stores.\\n2. Amortized bounds for operations may be unacceptable in real-time systems.\\n3. Insertions and deletions at interior positions of an array are expensive.\\nIn this chapter, we introduce a data structure known as a linked list ,w h i c h\\nprovides an alternative to an array-based sequence (such as a Python list). Both\\narray-based sequences and linked lists keep elements in a certain order, but us-\\ning a very different style. An array provides the more centralized representation,with one large chunk of memory capable of accommodating references to many\\nelements. A linked list, in contrast, relies on a more distributed representation in\\nwhich a lightweight object, known as a node , is allocated for each element. Each\\nnode maintains a reference to its element and one or more references to neighboringnodes in order to collectively represent the linear order of the sequence.\\nWe will demonstrate a trade-off of advantages and disadvantages when con-\\ntrasting array-based sequences and linked lists. Elements of a linked list cannot beefﬁciently accessed by a numeric index k, and we cannot tell just by examining a\\nnode if it is the second, ﬁfth, or twentieth node in the list. However, linked listsavoid the three disadvantages noted above for array-based sequences.\\n7.1 Singly Linked Lists\\nAsingly linked list , in its simplest form, is a collection of nodes that collectively\\nform a linear sequence. Each node stores a reference to an object that is an elementof the sequence, as well as a reference to the next node of the list (see Figures 7.1and 7.2).\\nnextMSP\\nelement\\nFigure 7.1: Example of a node instance that forms part of a singly linked list.

The list instance maintains a member named head that identiﬁes\\nthe ﬁrst node of the list, and in some applications another member named tailthat\\nidentiﬁes the last node of the list. The None object is denoted as Ø.\\nThe ﬁrst and last node of a linked list are known as the head andtailof the\\nlist, respectively. By starting at the head, and moving from one node to another\\nby following each node’s next reference, we can reach the tail of the list. We can\\nidentify the tail as the node having None as its next reference. This process is\\ncommonly known as traversing the linked list. Because the next reference of a\\nnode can be viewed as a link orpointer to another node, the process of traversing\\na list is also known as link hopping orpointer hopping .\\nA linked list’s representation in memory relies on the collaboration of many\\nobjects. Each node is represented as a unique object, with that instance storing areference to its element and a reference to the next node (or None ). Another object\\nrepresents the linked list as a whole. Minimally, the linked list instance must keepa reference to the head of the list. Without an explicit reference to the head, there\\nwould be no way to locate that node (or indirectly, any others). There is not an\\nabsolute need to store a direct reference to the tail of the list, as it could otherwisebe located by starting at the head and traversing the rest of the list. However,storing an explicit reference to the tail node is a common convenience to avoidsuch a traversal. In similar regard, it is common for the linked list instance to keep\\na count of the total number of nodes that comprise the list (commonly described as\\nthesizeof the list), to avoid the need to traverse the list to count the nodes.\\nFor the remainder of this chapter, we continue to illustrate nodes as objects,\\nand each node’s “next” reference as a pointer. However, for the sake of simplicity,we illustrate a node’s element embedded directly within the node structure, eventhough the element is, in fact, an independent object. For example, Figure 7.3 is amore compact illustration of the linked list from Figure 7.2.\\nLAX MSP BOS ATL\\nhead tail\\nFigure 7.3: A compact illustration of a singly linked list, with elements embedded\\nin the nodes (rather than more accurately drawn as references to external objects).'),\n",

When using a\\nsingly linked list, we can easily insert an element at the head of the list, as shown in\\nFigure 7.4, and described with pseudo-code in Code Fragment 7.1. The main ideais that we create a new node, set its element to the new element, set its next link to\\nrefer to the current head , and then set the list’s head to point to the new node.\\nATL BOS MSPhead\\n(a)\\nBOSnewest\\nMSP ATLhead\\nLAX\\n(b)\\nLAX MSP ATL BOShead newest\\n(c)\\nFigure 7.4: Insertion of an element at the head of a singly linked list: (a) before\\nthe insertion; (b) after creation of a new node; (c) after reassignment of the headreference.\\nAlgorithm add\\nﬁrst(L,e):\\nnewest =Node (e){create new node instance storing reference to element e}\\nnewest .next =L.head {set new node’s next to reference the old head node }\\nL.head =newest {set variable head to reference the new node }\\nL.size =L.size +1 {increment the node count }\\nCode Fragment 7.1: Inserting a new element at the beginning of a singly linked\\nlistL.

Singly Linked Lists 261\\n7.1.1 Implementing a Stack with a Singly Linked List\\nIn this section, we demonstrate use of a singly linked list by providing a complete\\nPython implementation of the stack ADT (see Section 6.1). In designing such animplementation, we need to decide whether to model the top of the stack at the head\\nor at the tail of the list. There is clearly a best choice here; we can efﬁciently insert\\nand delete elements in constant time only at the head. Since all stack operationsaffect the top, we orient the top of the stack at the head of our list.\\nTo represent individual nodes of the list, we develop a lightweight\\nNode class.\\nThis class will never be directly exposed to the user of our stack class, so we willformally deﬁne it as a nonpublic, nested class of our eventual LinkedStack class\\n(see Section 2.5.1 for discussion of nested classes). The deﬁnition of the\\nNode\\nclass is shown in Code Fragment 7.4.\\nclass\\n Node:\\n”””Lightweight, nonpublic class for storing a singly linked node.”””\\nslots\\n =\\n_element\\n ,\\n_next\\n # streamline memory usage\\ndef\\n init\\n(self,e l e m e n t ,n e x t ) : # initialize node’s ﬁelds\\nself.\\nelement = element # reference to user’s element\\nself.\\nnext = next # reference to next node\\nCode Fragment 7.4: A lightweight\\n Node class for a singly linked list.\\nA node has only two instance variables:\\n element and\\nnext.

It was our use of modular arithmetic when “advancing”an index from the last slot to the ﬁrst slot that provided such an abstraction.\\nIn the case of linked lists, there is a more tangible notion of a circularly linked\\nlist, as we can have the tail of the list use its next reference to point back to the headof the list, as shown in Figure 7.7. We call such a structure a circularly linked list .\\nBOS\\nhead tailLAX MSP ATL\\nFigure 7.7: Example of a singly linked list with circular structure.\\nA circularly linked list provides a more general model than a standard linked\\nlist for data sets that are cyclic, that is, which do not have any particular notion of abeginning and end.

Even though a circularly linked list has no beginning or end, perse, we must maintain a reference to a particular node in order to make use of thelist. We use the identiﬁer current to describe such a designated node. By setting\\ncurrent = current.next , we can effectively advance through the nodes of the list.'),\n",

Circularly Linked Lists 267\\n7.2.1 Round-Robin Schedulers\\nTo motivate the use of a circularly linked list, we consider a round-robin scheduler,\\nwhich iterates through a collection of elements in a circular fashion and “services”\\neach element by performing a given action on it. Such a scheduler is used, for\\nexample, to fairly allocate a resource that must be shared by a collection of clients.\\nFor instance, round-robin scheduling is often used to allocate slices of CPU time tovarious applications running concurrently on a computer.\\nA round-robin scheduler could be implemented with the general queue ADT,\\nby repeatedly performing the following steps on queue Q(see Figure 7.9):\\n1.e=Q.dequeue ()\\n2.

One node is removed from the list, with\\nappropriate adjustments to the head of the list and the size decremented, and then a\\nnew node is created to reinsert at the tail of the list and the size is incremented.\\nIf using a circularly linked list, the effective transfer of an item from the “head”\\nof the list to the “tail” of the list can be accomplished by advancing a reference\\nthat marks the boundary of the queue. We will next provide an implementation\\nof aCircularQueue class that supports the entire queue ADT, together with an ad-\\nditional method, rotate() , that moves the ﬁrst element of the queue to the back.\\n(A similar method is supported by the deque class of Python’s collections module;\\nsee Table 6.4.) With this operation, a round-robin schedule can more efﬁciently be\\nimplemented by repeatedly performing the following steps:\\n1. Service element Q.front ()\\n2.Q.rotate ()'),\n",

Linked Lists\\n7.2.2 Implementing a Queue with a Circularly Linked List\\nTo implement the queue ADT using a circularly linked list, we rely on the intuition\\nof Figure 7.7, in which the queue has a head and a tail, but with the next reference ofthe tail linked to the head. Given such a model, there is no need for us to explicitly\\nstore references to both the head and the tail; as long as we keep a reference to the\\ntail, we can always ﬁnd the head by following the tail’s next reference.\\nCode Fragments 7.9 and 7.10 provide an implementation of a CircularQueue\\nclass based on this model. The only two instance variables are\\ntail,w h i c hi sa\\nreference to the tail node (or None when empty), and\\n size, which is the current\\nnumber of elements in the queue. When an operation involves the front of thequeue, we recognize self.\\ntail.\\nnext as the head of the queue. When enqueue is\\ncalled, a new node is placed just after the tail but before the current head, and thenthe new node becomes the tail.\\nIn addition to the traditional queue operations, the CircularQueue class supports\\narotate method that more efﬁciently enacts the combination of removing the front\\nelement and reinserting it at the back of the queue. With the circular representation,we simply set self.\\ntail = self.\\n tail.\\nnext to make the old head become the new tail\\n(with the node after the old head becoming the new head).\\n1classCircularQueue:\\n2”””Queue implementation using circularly linked list for storage.”””\\n34class\\nNode:\\n5 ”””Lightweight, nonpublic class for storing a singly linked node.”””\\n6 (omitted here; identical to that of LinkedStack.\\n Node)\\n78def\\ninit\\n(self):\\n9 ”””Create an empty queue.”””\\n10 self.\\ntail = None # will represent tail of queue\\n11 self.\\nsize = 0 # number of queue elements\\n1213def\\nlen\\n(self):\\n14 ”””Return the number of elements in the queue.”””\\n15 return self .\\nsize\\n1617defis\\nempty( self):\\n18 ”””Return True if the queue is empty.”””\\n19 return self .\\nsize == 0\\nCode Fragment 7.9: Implementation of a CircularQueue class, using a circularly\\nlinked list as storage (continued in Code Fragment 7.10).'),\n",

Linked Lists\\n7.3 Doubly Linked Lists\\nIn a singly linked list, each node maintains a reference to the node that is immedi-\\nately after it. We have demonstrated the usefulness of such a representation when\\nmanaging a sequence of elements. However, there are limitations that stem from\\nthe asymmetry of a singly linked list. In the opening of Section 7.1, we empha-sized that we can efﬁciently insert a node at either end of a singly linked list, andcan delete a node at the head of a list, but we are unable to efﬁciently delete a node\\nat the tail of the list. More generally, we cannot efﬁciently delete an arbitrary node\\nfrom an interior position of the list if only given a reference to that node, becausewe cannot determine the node that immediately precedes the node to be deleted\\n(yet, that node needs to have its next reference updated).\\nTo provide greater symmetry, we deﬁne a linked list in which each node keeps\\nan explicit reference to the node before it and a reference to the node after it. Sucha structure is known as a doubly linked list . These lists allow a greater variety of\\nO(1)-time update operations, including insertions and deletions at arbitrary posi-\\ntions within the list. We continue to use the term “next” for the reference to thenode that follows another, and we introduce the term “prev” for the reference to thenode that precedes it.\\nHeader and Trailer Sentinels\\nIn order to avoid some special cases when operating near the boundaries of a doublylinked list, it helps to add special nodes at both ends of the list: a header node at the\\nbeginning of the list, and a trailer node at the end of the list. These “dummy” nodes\\nare known as sentinels (or guards), and they do not store elements of the primary\\nsequence. A doubly linked list with such sentinels is shown in Figure 7.10.\\nSFO JFK PVDnext next next\\nprev prev prev prevheader trailernext\\nFigure 7.10: A doubly linked list representing the sequence {JFK, PVD, SFO },\\nusing sentinels header andtrailer to demarcate the ends of the list.\\nWhen using sentinel nodes, an empty list is initialized so that the next ﬁeld of\\nthe header points to the trailer, and the prev ﬁeld of the trailer points to the header;\\nthe remaining ﬁelds of the sentinels are irrelevant (presumably None , in Python).\\nFor a nonempty list, the header’s next will refer to a node containing the ﬁrst real\\nelement of a sequence, just as the trailer’s prev references the node containing the\\nlast element of a sequence.'),\n",

Doubly Linked Lists 271\\nAdvantage of Using Sentinels\\nAlthough we could implement a doubly linked list without sentinel nodes (as we\\ndid with our singly linked list in Section 7.1), the slight extra space devoted to the\\nsentinels greatly simpliﬁes the logic of our operations. Most notably, the header andtrailer nodes never change—only the nodes between them change. Furthermore,we can treat all insertions in a uniﬁed manner, because a new node will always beplaced between a pair of existing nodes. In similar fashion, every element that is to\\nbe deleted is guaranteed to be stored in a node that has neighbors on each side.\\nFor contrast, look back at our LinkedQueue implementation from Section 7.1.2.\\nItsenqueue method, given in Code Fragment 7.8, adds a new node to the end of\\nthe list. However, its implementation required a conditional to manage the specialcase of inserting into an empty list. In the general case, the new node was linked\\nafter the existing tail. But when adding to an empty list, there is no existing tail;instead it is necessary to reassign self.\\nhead to reference the new node. The use of\\na sentinel node in that implementation would eliminate the special case, as there\\nwould always be an existing node (possibly the header) before a new node.\\nInserting and Deleting with a Doubly Linked List\\nEvery insertion into our doubly linked list representation will take place betweena pair of existing nodes, as diagrammed in Figure 7.11. For example, when a new\\nelement is inserted at the front of the sequence, we will simply add the new nodebetween the header and the node that is currently after the header.

Doubly Linked Lists 273\\n7.3.1 Basic Implementation of a Doubly Linked List\\nWe begin by providing a preliminary implementation of a doubly linked list, in the\\nform of a class named\\n DoublyLinkedBase. We intentionally name the class with\\na leading underscore because we do not intend for it to provide a coherent publicinterface for general use. We will see that linked lists can support general insertionsand deletions in O(1)worst-case time, but only if the location of an operation\\ncan be succinctly identiﬁed. With array-based sequences, an integer index was aconvenient means for describing a position within a sequence. However, an index\\nis not convenient for linked lists as there is no efﬁcient way to ﬁnd the j\\nthelement;\\nit would seem to require a traversal of a portion of the list.\\nWhen working with a linked list, the most direct way to describe the location\\nof an operation is by identifying a relevant node of the list. However, we prefer\\nto encapsulate the inner workings of our data structure to avoid having users di-rectly access nodes of a list. In the remainder of this chapter, we will develop\\ntwo public classes that inherit from our\\nDoublyLinkedBase class to provide more\\ncoherent abstractions. Speciﬁcally, in Section 7.3.2, we provide a LinkedDeque\\nclass that implements the double-ended queue ADT introduced in Section 6.3; that\\nclass only supports operations at the ends of the queue, so there is no need for a\\nuser to identify an interior position within the list. In Section 7.4, we introduce a\\nnewPositionalList abstraction that provides a public interface that allows arbitrary\\ninsertions and deletions from a list.\\nOur low-level\\n DoublyLinkedBase class relies on the use of a nonpublic\\n Node\\nclass that is similar to that for a singly linked list, as given in Code Fragment 7.4,except that the doubly linked version includes a\\nprev attribute, in addition to the\\nnext and\\nelement attributes, as shown in Code Fragment 7.11.\\nclass\\n Node:\\n”””Lightweight, nonpublic class for storing a doubly linked node.”””\\nslots\\n =\\n_element\\n ,\\n_prev\\n ,\\n_next\\n # streamline memory\\ndef\\n init\\n(self, element, prev, next): # initialize node’s ﬁelds\\nself.\\nelement = element # user’s element\\nself.\\nprev = prev # previous node reference\\nself.\\nnext = next # next node reference\\nCode Fragment 7.11: A Python\\n Node class for use in a doubly linked list.\\nThe remainder of our\\n DoublyLinkedBase class is given in Code Fragment 7.12.\\nThe constructor instantiates the two sentinel nodes and links them directly to eachother.

Doubly Linked Lists 275\\nThe other two methods of our class are the nonpublic utilities,\\n insert\\n between\\nand\\ndelete\\n node . These provide generic support for insertions and deletions, re-\\nspectively, but require one or more node references as parameters. The implemen-\\ntation of the\\n insert\\n between method is modeled upon the algorithm that was previ-\\nously portrayed in Figure 7.11. It creates a new node, with that node’s ﬁelds initial-ized to link to the speciﬁed neighboring nodes. Then the ﬁelds of the neighboring\\nnodes are updated to include the newest node in the list. For later convenience, the\\nmethod returns a reference to the newly created node.\\nThe implementation of the\\ndelete\\n node method is modeled upon the algorithm\\nportrayed in Figure 7.13. The neighbors of the node to be deleted are linked directly\\nto each other, thereby bypassing the deleted node from the list. As a formality,\\nwe intentionally reset the\\n prev,\\nnext,a n d\\n element ﬁelds of the deleted node to\\nNone (after recording the element to be returned). Although the deleted node will\\nbe ignored by the rest of the list, setting its ﬁelds to None is advantageous as it\\nmay help Python’s garbage collection, since unnecessary links to the other nodes\\nand the stored element are eliminated. We will also rely on this conﬁguration to\\nrecognize a node as “deprecated” when it is no longer part of the list.\\n7.3.2 Implementing a Deque with a Doubly Linked List\\nThe double-ended queue (deque) ADT was introduced in Section 6.3. With an\\narray-based implementation, we achieve all operations in amortized O (1)time, due\\nto the occasional need to resize the array. With an implementation based upon a\\ndoubly linked list, we can achieve all deque operation in worst-case O (1)time.\\nWe provide an implementation of a LinkedDeque class (Code Fragment 7.13)\\nthat inherits from the\\n DoublyLinkedBase class of the preceding section. We do\\nnot provide an explicit\\n init\\n method for the LinkedDeque class, as the inherited\\nversion of that method sufﬁces to initialize a new instance. We also rely on theinherited methods\\nlen\\n andis\\nempty in meeting the deque ADT.\\nWith the use of sentinels, the key to our implementation is to remember that\\nthe header does not store the ﬁrst element of the deque—it is the node just after the\\nheader that stores the ﬁrst element (assuming the deque is nonempty). Similarly,the node just before the trailer stores the last element of the deque.\\nWe use the inherited\\ninsert\\n between method to insert at either end of the\\ndeque. To insert an element at the front of the deque, we place it immediately\\nbetween the header and the node just after the header. An insertion at the end of\\ndeque is placed immediately before the trailer node. Note that these operationssucceed, even when the deque is empty; in such a situation, the new node is placedbetween the two sentinels. When deleting an element from a nonempty deque, werely upon the inherited\\ndelete\\n node method, knowing that the designated node is\\nassured to have neighbors on each side.'),\n",

The Positional List ADT 277\\n7.4 The Positional List ADT\\nThe abstract data types that we have considered thus far, namely stacks, queues,\\nand double-ended queues, only allow update operations that occur at one end of a\\nsequence or the other. We wish to have a more general abstraction. For example,\\nalthough we motivated the FIFO semantics of a queue as a model for customerswho are waiting to speak with a customer service representative, or fans who arewaiting in line to buy tickets to a show, the queue ADT is too limiting. What ifa waiting customer decides to hang up before reaching the front of the customer\\nservice queue? Or what if someone who is waiting in line to buy tickets allows a\\nfriend to “cut” into line at that position? We would like to design an abstract datatype that provides a user a way to refer to elements anywhere in a sequence, and toperform arbitrary insertions and deletions.\\nWhen working with array-based sequences (such as a Python list), integer in-\\ndices provide an excellent means for describing the location of an element, or thelocation at which an insertion or deletion should take place. However, numeric in-dices are not a good choice for describing positions within a linked list because wecannot efﬁciently access an entry knowing only its index; ﬁnding an element at agiven index within a linked list requires traversing the list incrementally from its\\nbeginning or end, counting elements as we go.\\nFurthermore, indices are not a good abstraction for describing a local position\\nin some applications, because the index of an entry changes over time due to inser-\\ntions or deletions that happen earlier in the sequence. For example, it may not beconvenient to describe the location of a person waiting in line by knowing precisely\\nhow far away that person is from the front of the line. We prefer an abstraction, as\\ncharacterized in Figure 7.14, in which there is some other means for describinga position. We then wish to model situations such as when an identiﬁed personleaves the line before reaching the front, or in which a new person is added to a lineimmediately behind another identiﬁed person.\\nTicketsme\\nFigure 7.14: We wish to be able to identify the position of an element in a sequence\\nwithout the use of an integer index.'),\n",

Linked Lists\\nAs another example, a text document can be viewed as a long sequence of\\ncharacters. A word processor uses the abstraction of a cursor to describe a position\\nwithin the document without explicit use of an integer index, allowing operations\\nsuch as “delete the character at the cursor” or “insert a new character just after thecursor.” Furthermore, we may be able to refer to an inherent position within a doc-ument, such as the beginning of a particular section, without relying on a character\\nindex (or even a section number) that may change as the document evolves.\\nA Node Reference as a Position?\\nOne of the great beneﬁts of a linked list structure is that it is possible to perform\\nO(1)-time insertions and deletions at arbitrary positions of the list, as long as we\\nare given a reference to a relevant node of the list. It is therefore very tempting todevelop an ADT in which a node reference serves as the mechanism for describinga position. In fact, our\\nDoublyLinkedBase class of Section 7.3.1 has methods\\ninsert\\n between and\\ndelete\\n node that accept node references as parameters.\\nHowever, such direct use of nodes would violate the object-oriented design\\nprinciples of abstraction and encapsulation that were introduced in Chapter 2. There\\nare several reasons to prefer that we encapsulate the nodes of a linked list, for both\\nour sake and for the beneﬁt of users of our abstraction.\\n•It will be simpler for users of our data structure if they are not bothered withunnecessary details of our implementation, such as low-level manipulationof nodes, or our reliance on the use of sentinel nodes. Notice that to use the\\ninsert\\n between method of our\\n DoublyLinkedBase class to add a node at\\nthe beginning of a sequence, the header sentinel must be sent as a parameter.\\n•We can provide a more robust data structure if we do not permit users todirectly access or manipulate the nodes. In that way, we ensure that users\\ncannot invalidate the consistency of a list by mismanaging the linking of\\nnodes. A more subtle problem arises if a user were allowed to call the\\ninsert\\n between or\\ndelete\\n node method of our\\n DoublyLinkedBase class,\\nsending a node that does not belong to the given list as a parameter. (Go back\\nand look at that code and see why it causes a problem!)\\n•By better encapsulating the internal details of our implementation, we havegreater ﬂexibility to redesign the data structure and improve its performance.\\nIn fact, with a well-designed abstraction, we can provide a notion of a non-numeric position, even if using an array-based sequence.\\nFor these reasons, instead of relying directly on nodes, we introduce an inde-\\npendent position abstraction to denote the location of an element within a list, and\\nthen a complete positional list ADT that can encapsulate a doubly linked list (or\\neven an array-based sequence; see Exercise P-7.46).'),\n",

Linked Lists\\nNote well that the ﬁrst() andlast() methods of the positional list ADT return\\nthe associated positions , not the elements . (This is in contrast to the corresponding\\nﬁrst andlastmethods of the deque ADT.) The ﬁrst element of a positional list\\ncan be determined by subsequently invoking the element method on that position,\\nasL.ﬁrst().element() . The advantage of receiving a position as a return value is\\nthat we can use that position to navigate the list. For example, the following code\\nfragment prints all elements of a positional list named data.\\ncursor = data.ﬁrst()\\nwhile cursor is not None :\\nprint(cursor.element()) # print the element stored at the position\\ncursor = data.after(cursor) # advance to the next position (if any)\\nThis code relies on the stated convention that the None object is returned when\\nafter is called upon the last position. That return value is clearly distinguishable\\nfrom any legitimate position. The positional list ADT similarly indicates that theNone value is returned when the before method is invoked at the front of the list, or\\nwhenﬁrstorlastmethods are called upon an empty list.

The Positional List ADT 281\\n7.4.2 Doubly Linked List Implementation\\nIn this section, we present a complete implementation of a PositionalList class\\nusing a doubly linked list that satisﬁes the following important proposition.\\nProposition 7.2: Each method of the positional list ADT runs in worst-case O(1)\\ntime when implemented with a doubly linked list.\\nWe rely on the\\n DoublyLinkedBase class from Section 7.3.1 for our low-level\\nrepresentation; the primary responsibility of our new class is to provide a public\\ninterface in accordance with the positional list ADT. We begin our class deﬁnitionin Code Fragment 7.14 with the deﬁnition of the public Position class, nested within\\nourPositionalList class. Position instances will be used to represent the locations\\nof elements within the list. Our various PositionalList methods may end up creating\\nredundant Position instances that reference the same underlying node (for example,\\nwhenﬁrst andlastare the same). For that reason, our Position class deﬁnes the\\neq\\n and\\n ne\\n special methods so that a test such as p= =q evaluates to\\nTrue when two positions refer to the same node.\\nValidating Positions\\nEach time a method of the PositionalList class accepts a position as a parameter,\\nwe want to verify that the position is valid, and if so, to determine the underlyingnode associated with the position. This functionality is implemented by a non-public method named\\nvalidate . Internally, a position maintains a reference to the\\nassociated node of the linked list, and also a reference to the list instance that con-tains the speciﬁed node. With the container reference, we can robustly detect whena caller sends a position instance that does not belong to the indicated list.\\nWe are also able to detect a position instance that belongs to the list, but that\\nrefers to a node that is no longer part of that list. Recall that the\\ndelete\\n node of\\nthe base class sets the previous and next references of a deleted node to None ;w e\\ncan recognize that condition to detect a deprecated node.\\nAccess and Update Methods\\nThe access methods of the PositionalList class are given in Code Fragment 7.15\\nand the update methods are given in Code Fragment 7.16. All of these methods\\ntrivially adapt the underlying doubly linked list implementation to support the pub-\\nlic interface of the positional list ADT. Those methods rely on the\\n validate utility\\nto “unwrap” any position that is sent. They also rely on a\\n make\\n position utility\\nto “wrap” nodes as Position instances to return to the user, making sure never to\\nreturn a position referencing a sentinel. For convenience, we have overridden the\\ninherited\\n insert\\n between utility method so that ours returns a position associated\\nwith the newly created node (whereas the inherited version returns the node itself).'),\n",

Linked Lists\\n7.6 Case Study: Maintaining Access Frequencies\\nThe positional list ADT is useful in a number of settings. For example, a program\\nthat simulates a game of cards could model each person’s hand as a positional list(Exercise P-7.47). Since most people keep cards of the same suit together, inserting\\nand removing cards from a person’s hand could be implemented using the methods\\nof the positional list ADT, with the positions being determined by a natural orderof the suits. Likewise, a simple text editor embeds the notion of positional insertionand deletion, since such editors typically perform all updates relative to a cursor ,\\nwhich represents the current position in the list of characters of text being edited.\\nIn this section, we consider maintaining a collection of elements while keeping\\ntrack of the number of times each element is accessed. Keeping such access countsallows us to know which elements are among the most popular. Examples of suchscenarios include a Web browser that keeps track of a user’s most accessed URLs,\\nor a music collection that maintains a list of the most frequently played songs for\\na user. We model this with a new favorites list ADT that supports the lenand\\nis\\nempty methods as well as the following:\\naccess (e):Access the element e, incrementing its access count, and\\nadding it to the favorites list if it is not already present.\\nremove (e):Remove element efrom the favorites list, if present.\\ntop (k):Return an iteration of the kmost accessed elements.\\n7.6.1 Using a Sorted List\\nOur ﬁrst approach for managing a list of favorites is to store elements in a linkedlist, keeping them in nonincreasing order of access counts. We access or removean element by searching the list from the most frequently accessed to the leastfrequently accessed. Reporting the top kmost accessed elements is easy, as they\\nare the ﬁrst kentries of the list.\\nTo maintain the invariant that elements are stored in nonincreasing order of\\naccess counts, we must consider how a single access operation may affect the order.The accessed element’s count increases by one, and so it may become larger than\\none or more of its preceding neighbors in the list, thereby violating the invariant.\\nFortunately, we can reestablish the sorted invariant using a technique similar to\\na single pass of the insertion-sort algorithm, introduced in the previous section. We\\ncan perform a backward traversal of the list, starting at the position of the elementwhose access count has increased, until we locate a valid position after which the\\nelement can be relocated.'),\n",

Case Study: Maintaining Access Frequencies 289\\n7.6.2 Using a List with the Move-to-Front Heuristic\\nThe previous implementation of a favorites list performs the access(e) method in\\ntime proportional to the index of ein the favorites list. That is, if eis the kthmost\\npopular element in the favorites list, then accessing it takes O(k)time. In many\\nreal-life access sequences (e.g., Web pages visited by a user), once an element is\\naccessed it is more likely to be accessed again in the near future. Such scenariosare said to possess locality of reference .\\nAheuristic , or rule of thumb, that attempts to take advantage of the locality of\\nreference that is present in an access sequence is the move-to-front heuristic .T o\\napply this heuristic, each time we access an element we move it all the way to thefront of the list. Our hope, of course, is that this element will be accessed again inthe near future. Consider, for example, a scenario in which we have nelements and\\nthe following series of n\\n2accesses:\\n•element 1 is accessed ntimes\\n•element 2 is accessed ntimes\\n• ···\\n•element nis accessed ntimes.\\nIf we store the elements sorted by their access counts, inserting each element the\\nﬁrst time it is accessed, then\\n•each access to element 1 runs in O(1)time\\n•each access to element 2 runs in O(2)time\\n• ···\\n•each access to element nruns in O(n)time.\\nThus, the total time for performing the series of accesses is proportional to\\nn+2n+3n+···+n·n=n(1+2+3+···+n)=n·n(n+1)\\n2,\\nwhich is O(n3).\\nOn the other hand, if we use the move-to-front heuristic, inserting each element\\nthe ﬁrst time it is accessed, then\\n•each subsequent access to element 1 takes O(1)time\\n•each subsequent access to element 2 takes O(1)time\\n• ···•each subsequent access to element nruns in O(1)time.\\nSo the running time for performing all the accesses in this case is O(n\\n2). Thus,\\nthe move-to-front implementation has faster access times for this scenario. Still,\\nthe move-to-front approach is just a heuristic, for there are access sequences whereusing the move-to-front approach is slower than simply keeping the favorites list\\nordered by access counts.'),\n",

Linked Lists\\nThe Trade-Oﬀs with the Move-to-Front Heuristic\\nIf we no longer maintain the elements of the favorites list ordered by their access\\ncounts, when we are asked to ﬁnd the kmost accessed elements, we need to search\\nfor them. We will implement the top (k)method as follows:\\n1. We copy all entries of our favorites list into another list, named temp.\\n2. We scan the temp listktimes. In each scan, we ﬁnd the entry with the largest\\naccess count, remove this entry from temp , and report it in the results.\\nThis implementation of method toptakes O(kn)time. Thus, when kis a constant,\\nmethod topruns in O(n)time. This occurs, for example, when we want to get the\\n“top ten” list. However, if kis proportional to n,t h e ntop runs in O(n2)time. This\\noccurs, for example, when we want a “top 25%” list.\\nIn Chapter 9 we will introduce a data structure that will allow us to implement\\ntopinO(n+klogn)time (see Exercise P-9.54), and more advanced techniques\\ncould be used to perform topinO(n+klogk)time.\\nWe could easily achieve O(nlogn)time if we use a standard sorting algorithm\\nto reorder the temporary list before reporting the top k(see Chapter 12); this ap-\\nproach would be preferred to the original in the case that kisΩ(logn). (Recall\\nthe big-Omega notation introduced in Section 3.3.1 to give an asymptotic lower\\nbound on the running time of an algorithm.) There is a more specialized sorting\\nalgorithm (see Section 12.4.2) that can take advantage of the fact that access countsare integers in order to achieve O(n)time for top, for any value of k.\\nImplementing the Move-to-Front Heuristic in Python\\nWe give an implementation of a favorites list using the move-to-front heuristic in\\nCode Fragment 7.20. The new FavoritesListMTF class inherits most of its func-\\ntionality from the original FavoritesList as a base class.\\nBy our original design, the access method of the original class relies on a non-\\npublic utility named\\n move\\n upto enact the potential shifting of an element forward\\nin the list, after its access count had been incremented. Therefore, we implementthe move-to-front heuristic by simply overriding the\\nmove\\n upmethod so that each\\naccessed element is moved directly to the front of the list (if not already there). This\\naction is easily implemented by means of the positional list ADT.\\nThe more complex portion of our FavoritesListMTF class is the new deﬁnition\\nfor the topmethod. We rely on the ﬁrst of the approaches outlined above, inserting\\ncopies of the items into a temporary list and then repeatedly ﬁnding, reporting, and\\nremoving an element that has the largest access count of those remaining.'),\n",

Linked Lists\\n7.7 Link-Based vs. Array-Based Sequences\\nWe close this chapter by reﬂecting on the relative pros and cons of array-based\\nand link-based data structures that have been introduced thus far. The dichotomybetween these approaches presents a common design decision when choosing an\\nappropriate implementation of a data structure. There is not a one-size-ﬁts-all so-\\nlution, as each offers distinct advantages and disadvantages.\\nAdvantages of Array-Based Sequences\\n•Arrays provide O (1)-time access to an element based on an integer index.\\nThe ability to access the kthelement for any kinO(1)time is a hallmark\\nadvantage of arrays (see Section 5.2). In contrast, locating the kthelement\\nin a linked list requires O(k)time to traverse the list from the beginning,\\nor possibly O(n−k)time, if traversing backward from the end of a doubly\\nlinked list.\\n•Operations with equivalent asymptotic bounds typically run a constant factor\\nmore efﬁciently with an array-based structure versus a linked structure. As\\nan example, consider the typical enqueue operation for a queue. Ignoring\\nthe issue of resizing an array, this operation for the ArrayQueue class (see\\nCode Fragment 6.7) involves an arithmetic calculation of the new index, an\\nincrement of an integer, and storing a reference to the element in the array.\\nIn contrast, the process for a LinkedQueue (see Code Fragment 7.8) requires\\nthe instantiation of a node, appropriate linking of nodes, and an increment\\nof an integer. While this operation completes in O(1)time in either model,\\nthe actual number of CPU operations will be more in the linked version,\\nespecially given the instantiation of the new node.\\n•Array-based representations typically use proportionally less memory than\\nlinked structures. This advantage may seem counterintuitive, especially given\\nthat the length of a dynamic array may be longer than the number of elements\\nthat it stores. Both array-based lists and linked lists are referential structures,\\nso the primary memory for storing the actual objects that are elements is thesame for either structure. What differs is the auxiliary amounts of memorythat are used by the two structures. For an array-based container of nele-\\nments, a typical worst case may be that a recently resized dynamic array has\\nallocated memory for 2 nobject references. With linked lists, memory must\\nbe devoted not only to store a reference to each contained object, but also\\nexplicit references that link the nodes. So a singly linked list of length n\\nalready requires 2 nreferences (an element reference and next reference for\\neach node). With a doubly linked list, there are 3 nreferences.'),\n",

Link-Based vs. Array-Based Sequences 293\\nAdvantages of Link-Based Sequences\\n•Link-based structures provide worst-case time bounds for their operations.\\nThis is in contrast to the amortized bounds associated with the expansion or\\ncontraction of a dynamic array (see Section 5.3).\\nWhen many individual operations are part of a larger computation, and we\\nonly care about the total time of that computation, an amortized bound is as\\ngood as a worst-case bound precisely because it gives a guarantee on the sum\\nof the time spent on the individual operations.\\nHowever, if data structure operations are used in a real-time system that is de-\\nsigned to provide more immediate responses (e.g., an operating system, Webserver, air trafﬁc control system), a long delay caused by a single (amortized)operation may have an adverse effect.\\n•Link-based structures support O (1)-time insertions and deletions at arbi-\\ntrary positions. The ability to perform a constant-time insertion or deletion\\nwith the PositionalList class, by using a Position to efﬁciently describe the\\nlocation of the operation, is perhaps the most signiﬁcant advantage of thelinked list.\\nThis is in stark contrast to an array-based sequence. Ignoring the issue of\\nresizing an array, inserting or deleting an element from the end of an array-based list can be done in constant time. However, more general insertions anddeletions are expensive. For example, with Python’s array-based listclass, a\\ncall to insert orpopwith index kuses O(n−k+1)time because of the loop\\nto shift all subsequent elements (see Section 5.4).\\nAs an example application, consider a text editor that maintains a document\\nas a sequence of characters. Although users often add characters to the end\\nof the document, it is also possible to use the cursor to insert or delete one or\\nmore characters at an arbitrary position within the document. If the charac-ter sequence were stored in an array-based sequence (such as a Python list),\\neach such edit operation may require linearly many characters to be shifted,\\nleading to O(n)performance for each edit operation. With a linked-list rep-\\nresentation, an arbitrary edit operation (insertion or deletion of a character\\nat the cursor) can be performed in O(1)worst-case time, assuming we are\\ngiven a position that represents the location of the cursor.'),\n",

The relationships in a tree are hierarchical , with some\\nobjects being “above” and some “below” others. Actually, the main terminologyfor tree data structures comes from family trees, with the terms “parent,” “child,”“ancestor,” and “descendant” being the most common words used to describe rela-tionships.

Likewise, when using a tree to describe an inher-itance hierarchy, as in Figure 8.4, there is no particular signiﬁcance to the orderamong the subclasses of a parent class. Finally, we consider the use of a tree inmodeling a computer’s ﬁle system, as in Figure 8.3.

Trees\\nA Tree Abstract Base Class in Python\\nIn discussing the object-oriented design principle of abstraction in Section 2.1.2, we\\nnoted that a public interface for an abstract data type is often managed in Python viaduck typing . For example, we deﬁned the notion of the public interface for a queue\\nADT in Section 6.2, and have since presented several classes that implement thequeue interface (e.g., ArrayQueue in Section 6.2.2, LinkedQueue in Section 7.1.2,\\nCircularQueue in Section 7.2.2). However, we never gave any formal deﬁnition of\\nthe queue ADT in Python; all of the concrete implementations were self-containedclasses that just happen to adhere to the same public interface. A more formalmechanism to designate the relationships between different implementations of the\\nsame abstraction is through the deﬁnition of one class that serves as an abstract\\nbase class , via inheritance, for one or more concrete classes . (See Section 2.4.3.)\\nWe choose to deﬁne a Tree class, in Code Fragment 8.1, that serves as an ab-\\nstract base class corresponding to the tree ADT. Our reason for doing so is that thereis quite a bit of useful code that we can provide, even at this level of abstraction, al-\\nlowing greater code reuse in the concrete tree implementations we later deﬁne. TheTree class provides a deﬁnition of a nested Position class (which is also abstract),\\nand declarations of many of the accessor methods included in the tree ADT.\\nHowever, our Tree class does not deﬁne any internal representation for stor-\\ning a tree, and ﬁve of the methods given in that code fragment remain abstract\\n(root,parent ,num\\nchildren ,children ,a n d\\n len\\n ); each of these methods raises a\\nNotImplementedError . (A more formal approach for deﬁning abstract base classes\\nand abstract methods, using Python’s abcmodule, is described in Section 2.4.3.)\\nThe subclasses are responsible for overriding abstract methods, such as children ,t o\\nprovide a working implementation for each behavior, based on their chosen internalrepresentation.\\nAlthough the Tree class is an abstract base class, it includes several concrete\\nmethods with implementations that rely on calls to the abstract methods of the class.In deﬁning the tree ADT in the previous section, we declare ten accessor methods.Five of those are the ones we left as abstract, in Code Fragment 8.1. The other ﬁve\\ncan be implemented based on the former. Code Fragment 8.2 provides concrete\\nimplementations for methods is\\nroot,is\\nleaf,a n dis\\nempty . In Section 8.4, we will\\nexplore general algorithms for traversing a tree that can be used to provide concreteimplementations of the positions and\\niter\\n methods within the Tree class. The\\nbeauty of this design is that the concrete methods deﬁned within the Tree abstract\\nbase class will be inherited by all subclasses. This promotes greater code reuse, asthere will be no need for those subclasses to reimplement such behaviors.\\nWe note that, with the Tree class being abstract, there is no reason to create a\\ndirect instance of it, nor would such an instance be useful. The class exists to serve\\nas a base for inheritance, and users will create instances of concrete subclasses.'),\n",

If\\nthe method is initially called on the root of T, it will eventually be called once for\\neach position of T. This is because the root eventually invokes the recursion on\\neach of its children, which in turn invokes the recursion on each of their children,\\na n ds oo n .\\nWe can determine the running time of the height2 algorithm by summing, over\\nall the positions, the amount of time spent on the nonrecursive part of each call.(Review Section 4.2 for analyses of recursive processes.)

Although we do not yet have a concrete\\nimplementation of children(p) , we assume that such an iteration is generated in\\nO(c\\np+1)time, where cpdenotes the number of children of p.

In order to complete the analysis,\\nwe make use of the following property.\\nProposition 8.5: LetTbe a tree with npositions, and let cpdenote the number of\\nchildren of a position pofT.

Binary Trees 311\\n8.2 Binary Trees\\nAbinary tree is an ordered tree with the following properties:\\n1. Every node has at most two children.\\n2.

A left child precedes a right child in the order of children of a node.\\nThe subtree rooted at a left or right child of an internal node vis called a left subtree\\norright subtree , respectively, of v. A binary tree is proper if each node has either\\nzero or two children. Some people also refer to such trees as being fullbinary\\ntrees. Thus, in a proper binary tree, every internal node has exactly two children.\\nA binary tree that is not proper is improper .\\nExample 8.6: An important class of binary trees arises in contexts where we wish\\nto represent a number of different outcomes that can result from answering a series\\nof yes-or-no questions. Each internal node is associated with a question. Starting at\\nthe root, we go to the left or right child of the current node, depending on whether\\nthe answer to the question is “Yes” or “No.” With each decision, we follow an\\nedge from a parent to a child, eventually tracing a path in the tree from the root\\nto a leaf. Such binary trees are known as decision trees , because a leaf position p\\nin such a tree represents a decision of what to do if the questions associated with\\np’s ancestors are answered in a way that leads to p. A decision tree is a proper\\nbinary tree.

The piles are initially empty. By the end, we will show that the\\nexternal-node pile has one more node than the internal-node pile. We consider twocases:Case 1: IfThas only one node v, we remove vand place it on the external-node\\npile. Thus, the external-node pile has one node and the internal-node pile isempty.\\nCase 2: Otherwise ( Thas more than one node), we remove from Tan (arbitrary)\\nexternal node wand its parent v, which is an internal node.

Trees\\nPython Implementation of a Linked Binary Tree Structure\\nIn this section, we deﬁne a concrete LinkedBinaryTree class that implements the\\nbinary tree ADT by subclassing the BinaryTree class. Our general approach is very\\nsimilar to what we used when developing the PositionalList in Section 7.4: We\\ndeﬁne a simple, nonpublic\\n Node class to represent a node, and a public Position\\nclass that wraps a node. We provide a\\n validate utility for robustly checking the\\nvalidity of a given position instance when unwrapping it, and a\\n make\\n position\\nutility for wrapping a node as a position to return to a caller.\\nThose deﬁnitions are provided in Code Fragment 8.8. As a formality, the new\\nPosition class is declared to inherit immediately from BinaryTree.Position . Tech-\\nnically, the BinaryTree class deﬁnition (see Code Fragment 8.7) does not formally\\ndeclare such a nested class; it trivially inherits it from Tree.Position . A minor ben-\\neﬁt from this design is that our position class inherits the\\n ne\\n special method\\nso that syntax p! =q is derived appropriately relative to\\n eq\\n .\\nOur class deﬁnition continues, in Code Fragment 8.9, with a constructor and\\nwith concrete implementations for the methods that remain abstract in the Tree and\\nBinaryTree classes. The constructor creates an empty tree by initializing\\n root to\\nNone and\\nsizeto zero. These accessor methods are implemented with careful use\\nof the\\n validate and\\nmake\\n position utilities to safeguard against boundary cases.\\nOperations for Updating a Linked Binary Tree\\nThus far, we have provided functionality for examining an existing binary tree.\\nHowever, the constructor for our LinkedBinaryTree class results in an empty tree\\nand we have not provided any means for changing the structure or content of a tree.\\nWe chose not to declare update methods as part of the Tree orBinaryTree ab-\\nstract base classes for several reasons. First, although the principle of encapsula-\\ntion suggests that the outward behaviors of a class need not depend on the internal\\nrepresentation, the efﬁciency of the operations depends greatly upon the representa-\\ntion. We prefer to have each concrete implementation of a tree class offer the mostsuitable options for updating a tree.\\nThe second reason we do not provide update methods in the base class is that\\nwe may not want such update methods to be part of a public interface. There aremany applications of trees, and some forms of update operations that are suitablefor one application may be unacceptable in another. However, if we place an update\\nmethod in a base class, any class that inherits from that base will inherit the update\\nmethod. Consider, for example, the possibility of a method T.replace(p, e) that\\nreplaces the element stored at position pwith another element e. Such a general\\nmethod may be unacceptable in the context of an arithmetic expression tree (see\\nExample 8.7 on page 312, and a later case study in Section 8.5), because we may\\nwant to enforce that internal nodes store only operators as elements.'),\n",

Implementing Trees 319\\nFor linked binary trees, a reasonable set of update methods to support for gen-\\neral usage are the following:\\nT.add\\n root(e) :Create a root for an empty tree, storing eas the element,\\nand return the position of that root; an error occurs if the\\ntree is not empty.\\nT.add\\n left(p, e) :Create a new node storing element e, link the node as the\\nleft child of position p, and return the resulting position;\\nan error occurs if palready has a left child.\\nT.add\\n right(p, e) :Create a new node storing element e, link the node as the\\nright child of position p, and return the resulting position;\\nan error occurs if palready has a right child.\\nT.replace(p, e) :Replace the element stored at position pwith element e,\\nand return the previously stored element.\\nT.delete(p): Remove the node at position p, replacing it with its child,\\nif any, and return the element that had been stored at p;\\nan error occurs if phas two children.\\nT.attach(p, T1, T2) :Attach the internal structure of trees T1andT2, respec-\\ntively, as the left and right subtrees of leaf position pof\\nT, and reset T1andT2to empty trees; an error condition\\noccurs if pis not a leaf.\\nWe have speciﬁcally chosen this collection of operations because each can be\\nimplemented in O(1)worst-case time with our linked representation. The most\\ncomplex of these are delete andattach , due to the case analyses involving the\\nvarious parent-child relationships and boundary conditions, yet there remains only\\na constant number of operations to perform. (The implementation of both methods\\ncould be greatly simpliﬁed if we used a tree representation with a sentinel node,akin to our treatment of positional lists; see Exercise C-8.40).\\nTo avoid the problem of undesirable update methods being inherited by sub-\\nclasses of LinkedBinaryTree , we have chosen an implementation in which none\\nof the above methods are publicly supported. Instead, we provide nonpublic ver-\\nsions of each, for example, providing the underscored\\ndelete in lieu of a public\\ndelete . Our implementations of these six update methods are provided in Code\\nFragments 8.10 and 8.11.\\nIn particular applications, subclasses of LinkedBinaryTree can invoke the non-\\npublic methods internally, while preserving a public interface that is appropriatefor the application. A subclass may also choose to wrap one or more of the non-public update methods with a public method to expose it to the user. We leave asan exercise (R-8.15), the task of deﬁning a MutableLinkedBinaryTree subclass that\\nprovides public methods wrapping each of these six update methods.'),\n",

Trees\\n8.4.2 Breadth-First Tree Traversal\\nAlthough the preorder and postorder traversals are common ways of visiting the\\npositions of a tree, another common approach is to traverse a tree so that we visitall the positions at depth dbefore we visit the positions at depth d+1. Such an\\nalgorithm is known as a breadth-ﬁrst traversal .\\nA breadth-ﬁrst traversal is a common approach used in software for playing\\ngames. A game tree represents the possible choices of moves that might be made\\nby a player (or computer) during a game, with the root of the tree being the initialconﬁguration for the game. For example, Figure 8.17 displays a partial game tree\\nfor Tic-Tac-Toe.\\nXX X\\nO\\nXXO XO X\\nOX\\nOX\\nOOX X\\nOX\\nOX\\nOO\\nXX\\nO\\n163 241\\n56 8 7 9 10 11 12 13 14 15\\nFigure 8.17: Partial game tree for Tic-Tac-Toe, with annotations displaying the or-\\nder in which positions are visited in a breadth-ﬁrst traversal.\\nA breadth-ﬁrst traversal of such a game tree is often performed because a computer\\nmay be unable to explore a complete game tree in a limited amount of time. So the\\ncomputer will consider all moves, then responses to those moves, going as deep as\\ncomputational time allows.\\nPseudo-code for a breadth-ﬁrst traversal is given in Code Fragment 8.14. The\\nprocess is not recursive, since we are not traversing entire subtrees at once. We usea queue to produce a FIFO (i.e., ﬁrst-in ﬁrst-out) semantics for the order in which\\nwe visit nodes. The overall running time is O(n), due to the ncalls to enqueue and\\nncalls to dequeue .\\nAlgorithm breadthﬁrst(T) :\\nInitialize queue Qto contain T.root()\\nwhile Qnot empty do\\np=Q.dequeue() {p is the oldest entry in the queue }\\nperform the “visit” action for position p\\nforeach child cinT.children(p) do\\nQ.enqueue(c) {addp’s children to the end of the queue for later visits }\\nCode Fragment 8.14: Algorithm for performing a breadth-ﬁrst traversal of a tree.'),\n",

Trees\\nBinary Search Trees\\nAn important application of the inorder traversal algorithm arises when we store an\\nordered sequence of elements in a binary tree, deﬁning a structure we call a binary\\nsearch tree .L e t Sbe a set whose unique elements have an order relation. For\\nexample, Scould be a set of integers.

The above properties\\nassure that an inorder traversal of a binary search tree Tvisits the elements in\\nnondecreasing order.\\n362531\\n42\\n1262\\n7558\\n90\\nFigure 8.19: A binary search tree storing integers. The solid path is traversed when\\nsearching (successfully) for 36. The dashed path is traversed when searching (un-\\nsuccessfully) for 70.\\nWe can use a binary search tree Tfor set Sto ﬁnd whether a given search\\nvalue vis in S, by traversing a path down the tree T, starting at the root. At each\\ninternal position pencountered, we compare our search value vwith the element\\ne(p)stored at p.I f v<e(p), then the search continues in the left subtree of p.\\nIfv=e(p), then the search terminates successfully. If v>e(p), then the search\\ncontinues in the right subtree of p. Finally, if we reach an empty subtree, the search\\nterminates unsuccessfully. In other words, a binary search tree can be viewed as abinary decision tree (recall Example 8.6), where the question asked at each internalnode is whether the element at that node is less than, equal to, or larger than the\\nelement being searched for. We illustrate several examples of the search operation\\nin Figure 8.19.\\nNote that the running time of searching in a binary search tree Tis proportional\\nto the height of T. Recall from Proposition 8.8 that the height of a binary tree with\\nnnodes can be as small as log (n+1)−1 or as large as n−1. Thus, binary search\\ntrees are most efﬁcient when they have small height. Chapter 11 is devoted to thestudy of search trees.'),\n",

Tree Traversal Algorithms 333\\n8.4.4 Implementing Tree Traversals in Python\\nWhen ﬁrst deﬁning the tree ADT in Section 8.1.2, we stated that tree Tshould\\ninclude support for the following methods:\\nT.positions() :Generate an iteration of all positions of tree T.\\niter(T) :Generate an iteration of all elements stored within tree T.\\nAt that time, we did not make any assumption about the order in which these\\niterations report their results. In this section, we demonstrate how any of the tree\\ntraversal algorithms we have introduced could be used to produce these iterations.\\nTo begin, we note that it is easy to produce an iteration of all elements of a\\ntree, if we rely on a presumed iteration of all positions. Therefore, support fortheiter(T) syntax can be formally provided by a concrete implementation of the\\nspecial method\\niter\\n within the abstract base class Tree.

We will support a public\\nmethod with calling signature T.preorder() for tree T, which generates a preorder\\niteration of all positions within the tree. However, the recursive algorithm for gen-\\nerating a preorder traversal, as originally described in Code Fragment 8.12, must\\nbe parameterized by a speciﬁc position within the tree that serves as the root of asubtree to traverse. A standard solution for such a circumstance is to deﬁne a non-public utility method with the desired recursive parameterization, and then to havethe public method preorder invoke the nonpublic method upon the root of the tree.\\nOur implementation of such a design is given in Code Fragment 8.17.'),\n",

For example, the table of contents associated with the tree from Figure 8.15\\nis displayed in Figure 8.20. Part (a) of that ﬁgure gives a simple presentation withone element per line; part (b) shows a more attractive presentation produced byindenting each element based on its depth within the tree. A similar presentationcould be used to display the contents of a computer’s ﬁle system, based on its tree\\nrepresentation (as in Figure 8.3).\\nPaper PaperTitle Title\\nAbstract Abstract\\n1\\n 1\\n1.1\\n 1.1\\n1.2\\n 1.2\\n2\\n 2\\n2.1\\n 2.1\\n... ...\\n(a) (b)\\nFigure 8.20: Table of contents for a document represented by the tree in Figure 8.15:\\n(a) without indentation; (b) with indentation based on depth within the tree.\\nThe unindented version of the table of contents, given a tree T, can be produced\\nwith the following code:\\nforpinT.preorder():\\nprint(p.element())\\nTo produce the presentation of Figure 8.20(b), we indent each element with a\\nnumber of spaces equal to twice the element’s depth in the tree (hence, the root ele-\\nment was unindented).

Trees\\nA preferred approach to producing an indented table of contents is to redesign\\na top-down recursion that includes the current depth as an additional parameter.\\nSuch an implementation is provided in Code Fragment 8.23.

More generally, we might be interested\\nin using a preorder traversal to display the structure of a tree, with indentation and\\nalso explicit numbering that was not present in the tree. For example, we mightdisplay the tree from Figure 8.2 beginning as:\\nElectronics R’Us\\n1 R&D2 Sales\\n2.1 Domestic2.2 International\\n2.2.1 Canada2.2.2 S. America\\nThis is more challenging, because the numbers used as labels are implicit in\\nthe structure of the tree. A label depends on the index of each position, relative toits siblings, along the path from the root to the current position. To accomplish thetask, we add a representation of that path as an additional parameter to the recursive\\nsignature. Speciﬁcally, we use a list of zero-indexed numbers, one for each position\\nalong the downward path, other than the root. (We convert those numbers to one-indexed form when printing.)\\nAt the implementation level, we wish to avoid the inefﬁciency of duplicating\\nsuch lists when sending a new parameter from one level of the recursion to the next.A standard solution is to share the same list instance throughout the recursion. Atone level of the recursion, a new entry is temporarily added to the end of the listbefore making further recursive calls. In order to “leave no trace,” that same blockof code must remove the extraneous entry from the list before completing its task.\\nAn implementation based on this approach is given in Code Fragment 8.24.'),\n",

Some additional context is necessary for the\\nstructure of the tree to be well deﬁned. The use of indentation or numbered labels\\nprovides such context, with a very human-friendly presentation. However, thereare more concise string representations of trees that are computer-friendly.\\nIn this section, we explore one such representation.

Unfortunately, they also show that the speciﬁc imple-mentations of the preorder andpostorder methods of our Tree class, or the inorder\\nmethod of the BinaryTree class, are not general enough to capture the range of\\ncomputations we desire. In some cases, we need more of a blending of the ap-proaches, with initial work performed before recurring on subtrees, additional workperformed after those recursions, and in the case of a binary tree, work performed\\nbetween the two possible recursions. Furthermore, in some contexts it was impor-\\ntant to know the depth of a position, or the complete path from the root to thatposition, or to return information from one level of the recursion to another. Foreach of the previous applications, we were able to develop a custom implementa-tion to properly adapt the recursive ideas, but the great principles of object-oriented\\nprogramming introduced in Section 2.1.1 include adaptability andreusability .\\nIn this section, we develop a more general framework for implementing tree\\ntraversals based on a concept known as an Euler tour traversal .

If a node has onlyone child, a tour differentiates between whether that is a left child or a right child,with the “in visit” taking place after the visit of a sole left child, but before the visitof a sole right child.

Trees\\n8.5 Case Study: An Expression Tree\\nIn Example 8.7, we introduced the use of a binary tree to represent the structure of\\nan arithmetic expression. In this section, we deﬁne a new ExpressionTree class that\\nprovides support for constructing such trees, and for displaying and evaluating the\\narithmetic expression that such a tree represents. Our ExpressionTree class is de-\\nﬁned as a subclass of LinkedBinaryTree , and we rely on the nonpublic mutators to\\nconstruct such trees. Each internal node must store a string that deﬁnes a binary op-\\nerator (e.g.,\\n +\\n), and each leaf must store a numeric value (or a string representing\\na numeric value).\\nOur eventual goal is to build arbitrarily complex expression trees for compound\\narithmetic expressions such as (((3+1)×4)/((9−5)+2)). However, it sufﬁces\\nfor the ExpressionTree class to support two basic forms of initialization:\\nExpressionTree(value) :Create a tree storing the given value at the root.\\nExpressionTree (op,E1,E2):Create a tree storing string opat the root (e.g., +),\\nand with the structures of existing ExpressionTree\\ninstances E1andE2as the left and right subtrees of\\nthe root, respectively.\\nSuch a constructor for the ExpressionTree class is given in Code Fragment 8.35.\\nThe class formally inherits from LinkedBinaryTree , so it has access to all the non-\\npublic update methods that were deﬁned in Section 8.3.1. We use\\n add\\nroot to cre-\\nate an initial root of the tree storing the token provided as the ﬁrst parameter. Thenwe perform run-time checking of the parameters to determine whether the caller\\ninvoked the one-parameter version of the constructor (in which case, we are done),\\nor the three-parameter form. In that case, we use the inherited\\nattach method to\\nincorporate the structure of the existing trees as subtrees of the root.\\nComposing a Parenthesized String Representation\\nA string representation of an existing expression tree instance, for example, as\\n(((3+1)x4)/((9-5)+2))\\n , can be produced by displaying tree elements us-\\ning an inorder traversal, but with opening and closing parentheses inserted witha preorder and postorder step, respectively. In the context of an ExpressionTree\\nclass, we support a special\\nstr\\n method (see Section 2.3.2) that returns the\\nappropriate string. Because it is more efﬁcient to ﬁrst build a sequence of individ-ual strings to be joined together (see discussion of “Composing Strings” in Sec-tion 5.4.2), the implementation of\\nstr\\n relies on a nonpublic, recursive method\\nnamed\\n parenthesize\\n recur that appends a series of strings to a list. These methods\\nare included in Code 8.35.'),\n",

The Priority Queue Abstract Data Type 363\\n9.1 The Priority Queue Abstract Data Type\\n9.1.1 Priorities\\nIn Chapter 6, we introduced the queue ADT as a collection of objects that are\\nadded and removed according to the ﬁrst-in, ﬁrst-out (FIFO ) principle. A com-\\npany’s customer call center embodies such a model in which waiting customers are\\ntold “calls will be answered in the order that they were received.” In that setting, a\\nnew call is added to the back of the queue, and each time a customer service rep-resentative becomes available, he or she is connected with the call that is removedfrom the front of the call queue.\\nIn practice, there are many applications in which a queue-like structure is used\\nto manage objects that must be processed in some way, but for which the ﬁrst-in,\\nﬁrst-out policy does not sufﬁce. Consider, for example, an air-trafﬁc control center\\nthat has to decide which ﬂight to clear for landing from among many approachingthe airport. This choice may be inﬂuenced by factors such as each plane’s distancefrom the runway, time spent waiting in a holding pattern, or amount of remaining\\nfuel. It is unlikely that the landing decisions are based purely on a FIFO policy.\\nThere are other situations in which a “ﬁrst come, ﬁrst serve” policy might seem\\nreasonable, yet for which other priorities come into play. To use another airline\\nanalogy, suppose a certain ﬂight is fully booked an hour prior to departure. Be-cause of the possibility of cancellations, the airline maintains a queue of standbypassengers hoping to get a seat. Although the priority of a standby passenger is\\ninﬂuenced by the check-in time of that passenger, other considerations include the\\nfare paid and frequent-ﬂyer status. So it may be that an available seat is given toa passenger who has arrived later than another, if such a passenger is assigned a\\nbetter priority by the airline agent.\\nIn this chapter, we introduce a new abstract data type known as a priority queue .\\nThis is a collection of prioritized elements that allows arbitrary element insertion,\\nand allows the removal of the element that has ﬁrst priority. When an element is\\nadded to a priority queue, the user designates its priority by providing an associatedkey. The element with the minimum key will be the next to be removed from the\\nqueue (thus, an element with key 1 will be given priority over an element with\\nkey 2). Although it is quite common for priorities to be expressed numerically, any\\nPython object may be used as a key, as long as the object type supports a consistentmeaning for the test a<b, for any instances aandb, so as to deﬁne a natural\\norder of the keys. With such generality, applications may develop their own notionof priority for each element. For example, different ﬁnancial analysts may assign\\ndifferent ratings (i.e., priorities) to a particular asset, such as a share of stock.'),\n",

Priority Queues\\n9.1.2 The Priority Queue ADT\\nFormally, we model an element and its priority as a key-value pair. We deﬁne the\\npriority queue ADT to support the following methods for a priority queue P:\\nP.add(k, v) :Insert an item with key kand value vinto priority queue P.\\nP.min() :Return a tuple, (k,v) , representing the key and value of an\\nitem in priority queue Pwith minimum key (but do not re-\\nmove the item); an error occurs if the priority queue is empty.\\nP.remove\\n min() :Remove an item with minimum key from priority queue P,\\nand return a tuple, (k,v) , representing the key and value of the\\nremoved item; an error occurs if the priority queue is empty.\\nP.is\\nempty() :Return True if priority queue Pdoes not contain any items.\\nlen(P) :Return the number of items in priority queue P.\\nA priority queue may have multiple entries with equivalent keys, in which case\\nmethods minandremove\\n minmay report an arbitrary choice of item having mini-\\nmum key.

In Section 9.5, we consideran extension that allows a user to update an element’s key within the priority queue.\\nExample 9.1:\\nThe following table shows a series of operations and their effects\\non an initially empty priority queue P.

Implementing a Priority Queue 365\\n9.2 Implementing a Priority Queue\\nIn this section, we show how to implement a priority queue by storing its entries in\\na positional list L. (See Section 7.4.) We provide two realizations, depending on\\nwhether or not we keep the entries in Lsorted by key.\\n9.2.1 The Composition Design Pattern\\nOne challenge in implementing a priority queue is that we must keep track of bothan element and its key, even as items are relocated within our data structure. Thisis reminiscent of a case study from Section 7.6 in which we maintain access counts\\nwith each element. In that setting, we introduced the composition design pattern ,\\ndeﬁning an\\nItem class that assured that each element remained paired with its\\nassociated count in our primary data structure.\\nFor priority queues, we will use composition to store items internally as pairs\\nconsisting of a key kand a value v. To implement this concept for all priority queue\\nimplementations, we provide a PriorityQueueBase class (see Code Fragment 9.1)\\nthat includes a deﬁnition for a nested class named\\n Item .

Priority Queues\\n9.2.2 Implementation with an Unsorted List\\nIn our ﬁrst concrete implementation of a priority queue, we store entries within\\nanunsorted list .O u rUnsortedPriorityQueue class is given in Code Fragment 9.2,\\ninheriting from the PriorityQueueBase class introduced in Code Fragment 9.1. For\\ninternal storage, key-value pairs are represented as composites, using instances of\\nthe inherited\\n Item class. These items are stored within a PositionalList , identiﬁed\\nas the\\n data member of our class. We assume that the positional list is implemented\\nwith a doubly-linked list, as in Section 7.4, so that all operations of that ADTexecute in O(1)time.\\nWe begin with an empty list when a new priority queue is constructed. At all\\ntimes, the size of the list equals the number of key-value pairs currently stored in thepriority queue. For this reason, our priority queue\\nlen\\n method simply returns\\nthe length of the internal\\n data list. By the design of our PriorityQueueBase class,\\nwe inherit a concrete implementation of the is\\nempty method that relies on a call to\\nour\\n len\\n method.\\nEach time a key-value pair is added to the priority queue, via the addmethod,\\nwe create a new\\n Item composite for the given key and value, and add that item to\\nthe end of the list. Such an implementation takes O(1)time.\\nThe remaining challenge is that when minorremove\\n minis called, we must\\nlocate the item with minimum key. Because the items are not sorted, we mustinspect all entries to ﬁnd one with a minimum key. For convenience, we deﬁne anonpublic\\nﬁnd\\nminutility that returns the position of an item with minimum key.\\nKnowledge of the position allows the remove\\n min method to invoke the delete\\nmethod on the positional list. The minmethod simply uses the position to retrieve\\nthe item when preparing a key-value tuple to return. Due to the loop for ﬁnding theminimum key, both minandremove\\nminmethods run in O(n)time, where nis the\\nnumber of entries in the priority queue.\\nA summary of the running times for the UnsortedPriorityQueue class is given\\nin Table 9.1.\\nOperation\\n Running Time\\nlen\\n O(1)\\nis\\nempty\\n O(1)\\nadd\\n O(1)\\nmin\\n O(n)\\nremove\\n min\\n O(n)\\nTable 9.1: Worst-case running times of the methods of a priority queue of size\\nn, realized by means of an unsorted, doubly linked list.

Priority Queues\\n9.3 Heaps\\nThe two strategies for implementing a priority queue ADT in the previous section\\ndemonstrate an interesting trade-off. When using an unsorted list to store entries,\\nwe can perform insertions in O(1)time, but ﬁnding or removing an element with\\nminimum key requires an O(n)-time loop through the entire collection. In contrast,\\nif using a sorted list, we can trivially ﬁnd or remove the minimum element in O(1)\\ntime, but adding a new element to the queue may require O(n)time to restore the\\nsorted order.\\nIn this section, we provide a more efﬁcient realization of a priority queue using\\na data structure called a binary heap . This data structure allows us to perform both\\ninsertions and removals in logarithmic time, which is a signiﬁcant improvementover the list-based implementations discussed in Section 9.2. The fundamental\\nway the heap achieves this improvement is to use the structure of a binary tree toﬁnd a compromise between elements being entirely unsorted and perfectly sorted.\\n9.3.1 The Heap Data Structure\\nA heap (see Figure 9.1) is a binary tree Tthat stores a collection of items at its\\npositions and that satisﬁes two additional properties: a relational property deﬁned\\nin terms of the way keys are stored in Tand a structural property deﬁned in terms\\nof the shape of Titself. The relational property is the following:\\nHeap-Order Property :In a heap T, for every position pother than the root, the\\nkey stored at pis greater than or equal to the key stored at p’s parent.\\nAs a consequence of the heap-order property, the keys encountered on a path from\\nthe root to a leaf of Tare in nondecreasing order. Also, a minimum key is always\\nstored at the root of T. This makes it easy to locate such an item when min or\\nremove\\n minis called, as it is informally said to be “at the top of the heap” (hence,\\nthe name “heap” for the data structure). By the way, the heap data structure deﬁned\\nhere has nothing to do with the memory heap (Section 15.1.1) used in the run-time\\nenvironment supporting a programming language like Python.\\nFor the sake of efﬁciency, as will become clear later, we want the heap Tto have\\nas small a height as possible. We enforce this requirement by insisting that the heap\\nTsatisfy an additional structural property—it must be what we term complete .\\nComplete Binary Tree Property: A heap Twith height his acomplete binary tree\\nif levels 0 ,1,2,..., h−1o f Thave the maximum number of nodes possible\\n(namely, level ihas 2inodes, for 0 ≤i≤h−1) and the remaining nodes at\\nlevel hreside in the leftmost possible positions at that level.'),\n",

The last position\\nis the one storing entry (13,W).\\nThe tree in Figure 9.1 is complete because levels 0, 1, and 2 are full, and the six\\nnodes in level 3 are in the six leftmost possible positions at that level. In formalizing\\nwhat we mean by the leftmost possible positions, we refer to the discussion of level\\nnumbering from Section 8.3.2, in the context of an array-based representation of a\\nbinary tree. (In fact, in Section 9.3.3 we will discuss the use of an array to representa heap.) A complete binary tree with nelements is one that has positions with level\\nnumbering 0 through n−1. For example, in an array-based representation of the\\nabove tree, its 13 entries would be stored consecutively from A[0]toA[12].\\nThe Height of a Heap\\nLethdenote the height of T.

Therefore\\nn≥2h−1+1=2hand n≤2h−1+2h=2h+1−1.\\nBy taking the logarithm of both sides of inequality 2h≤n, we see that height\\nh≤logn.

Priority Queues\\n9.3.2 Implementing a Priority Queue with a Heap\\nProposition 9.2 has an important consequence, for it implies that if we can perform\\nupdate operations on a heap in time proportional to its height, then those opera-tions will run in logarithmic time. Let us therefore turn to the problem of how to\\nefﬁciently perform various priority queue methods using a heap.\\nWe will use the composition pattern from Section 9.2.1 to store key-value pairs\\nas items in the heap. The lenandis\\nempty methods can be implemented based\\non examination of the tree, and the min operation is equally trivial because the\\nheap property assures that the element at the root of the tree has a minimum key.\\nThe interesting algorithms are those for implementing the add andremove\\n min\\nmethods.\\nAdding an Item to the Heap\\nLet us consider how to perform add(k,v) on a priority queue implemented with a\\nheap T. We store the pair (k,v)as an item at a new node of the tree. To maintain\\nthecomplete binary tree property , that new node should be placed at a position p\\njust beyond the rightmost node at the bottom level of the tree, or as the leftmostposition of a new level, if the bottom level is already full (or if the heap is empty).\\nUp-Heap Bubbling After an Insertion\\nAfter this action, the tree Tis complete, but it may violate the heap-order property .\\nHence, unless position pis the root of T(that is, the priority queue was empty\\nbefore the insertion), we compare the key at position pto that of p’s parent, which\\nwe denote as q.I fk e y kp≥kq, the heap-order property is satisﬁed and the algorithm\\nterminates. If instead kp<kq, then we need to restore the heap-order property,\\nwhich can be locally achieved by swapping the entries stored at positions pandq.\\n(See Figure 9.2c and d.) This swap causes the new item to move up one level.Again, the heap-order property may be violated, so we repeat the process, going upinTuntil no violation of the heap-order property occurs. (See Figure 9.2e and h.)\\nThe upward movement of the newly inserted entry by means of swaps is con-\\nventionally called up-heap bubbling . A swap either resolves the violation of the\\nheap-order property or propagates it one level up in the heap. In the worst case, up-heap bubbling causes the new entry to move all the way up to the root of heap T.\\nThus, in the worst case, the number of swaps performed in the execution of method\\naddis equal to the height of T. By Proposition 9.2, that bound is ⌊logn⌋.'),\n",

Priority Queues\\nRemoving the Item with Minimum Key\\nLet us now turn to method remove\\n minof the priority queue ADT. We know that\\nan entry with the smallest key is stored at the root rofT(even if there is more than\\none entry with smallest key). However, in general we cannot simply delete node r,\\nbecause this would leave two disconnected subtrees.\\nInstead, we ensure that the shape of the heap respects the complete binary tree\\nproperty by deleting the leaf at the lastposition pofT, deﬁned as the rightmost\\nposition at the bottommost level of the tree. To preserve the item from the last\\nposition p, we copy it to the root r(in place of the item with minimum key that is\\nbeing removed by the operation). Figure 9.3a and b illustrates an example of thesesteps, with minimal item (4,C)being removed from the root and replaced by item\\n(13,W)from the last position. The node at the last position is removed from the\\ntree.\\nDown-Heap Bubbling After a Removal\\nWe are not yet done, however, for even though Tis now complete, it likely violates\\nthe heap-order property. If Thas only one node (the root), then the heap-order\\nproperty is trivially satisﬁed and the algorithm terminates. Otherwise, we distin-guish two cases, where pinitially denotes the root of T:\\n•Ifphas no right child, let cbe the left child of p.\\n•Otherwise ( phas both children), let cbe a child of pwith minimal key.\\nIf key k\\np≤kc, the heap-order property is satisﬁed and the algorithm terminates. If\\ninstead kp>kc, then we need to restore the heap-order property. This can be locally\\nachieved by swapping the entries stored at pandc. (See Figure 9.3c and d.) It is\\nworth noting that when phas two children, we intentionally consider the smaller\\nkey of the two children. Not only is the key of csmaller than that of p,i ti sa t\\nleast as small as the key at c’s sibling. This ensures that the heap-order property is\\nlocally restored when that smaller key is promoted above the key that had been at\\npand that at c’s sibling.\\nHaving restored the heap-order property for node prelative to its children, there\\nmay be a violation of this property at c; hence, we may have to continue swapping\\ndown Tuntil no violation of the heap-order property occurs. (See Figure 9.3e–h.)\\nThis downward swapping process is called down-heap bubbling . A swap either\\nresolves the violation of the heap-order property or propagates it one level down inthe heap. In the worst case, an entry moves all the way down to the bottom level.(See Figure 9.3.) Thus, the number of swaps performed in the execution of methodremove\\nminis, in the worst case, equal to the height of heap T, that is, it is ⌊logn⌋\\nby Proposition 9.2.'),\n",

In particular, the add\\nandremove\\n min operations of a priority queue both depend on locating the last\\nindex of a heap of size n. With the array-based representation, the last position\\nis at index n−1 of the array. Locating the last position of a complete binary tree\\nimplemented with a linked structure requires more effort. (See Exercise C-9.34.)\\nIf the size of a priority queue is not known in advance, use of an array-based\\nrepresentation does introduce the need to dynamically resize the array on occasion,\\nas is done with a Python list.

However, if all nkey-value pairs to be\\nstored in the heap are given in advance, such as during the ﬁrst phase of the heap-\\nsort algorithm, there is an alternative bottom-up construction method that runs in\\nO(n)time. (Heap-sort, however, still requires Θ(nlogn)time because of the second\\nphase in which we repeatedly remove the remaining element with smallest key.)\\nIn this section, we describe the bottom-up heap construction, and provide an\\nimplementation that can be used by the constructor of a heap-based priority queue.\\nFor simplicity of exposition, we describe this bottom-up heap construction as-\\nsuming the number of keys, n, is an integer such that n=2h+1−1. That is,\\nthe heap is a complete binary tree with every level being full, so the heap has\\nheight h=log (n+1)−1.

Priority Queues\\nPython Implementation of a Bottom-Up Heap Construction\\nImplementing a bottom-up heap construction is quite easy, given the existence of\\na “down-heap” utility function. The “merging” of two equally sized heaps that\\nare subtrees of a common position p, as described in the opening of this section,\\ncan be accomplished simply by down-heaping p’s entry. For example, that is what\\nhappened to the key 14 in going from Figure 9.5(f) to (g).\\nWith our array-based representation of a heap, if we initially store all nitems in\\narbitrary order within the array, we can implement the bottom-up heap construction\\nprocess with a single loop that makes a call to\\n downheap from each position of\\nthe tree, as long as those calls are ordered starting with the deepest level and ending\\nwith the root of the tree. In fact, that loop can start with the deepest nonleaf, sincethere is no effect when down-heap is called at a leaf position.\\nIn Code Fragment 9.6, we augment the original HeapPriorityQueue class from\\nSection 9.3.4 to provide support for the bottom-up construction of an initial col-lection. We introduce a nonpublic utility method,\\nheapify , that calls\\n downheap\\non each nonleaf position, beginning with the deepest and concluding with a call atthe root of the tree. We have redesigned the constructor of the class to accept an\\noptional parameter that can be any sequence of (k,v) tuples. Rather than initializing\\nself.\\ndata to an empty list, we use a list comprehension syntax (see Section 1.9.2)\\nto create an initial list of item composites based on the given contents.

Heaps 383\\nAsymptotic Analysis of Bottom-Up Heap Construction\\nBottom-up heap construction is asymptotically faster than incrementally inserting\\nnkeys into an initially empty heap. Intuitively, we are performing a single down-\\nheap operation at each position in the tree, rather than a single up-heap operationfrom each. Since more nodes are closer to the bottom of a tree than the top, thesum of the downward paths is linear, as shown in the following proposition.\\nProposition 9.3:\\nBottom-up construction of a heap with nentries takes O(n)\\ntime, assuming two keys can be compared in O(1)time.\\nJustiﬁcation: The primary cost of the construction is due to the down-heap\\nsteps performed at each nonleaf position. Let πvdenote the path of Tfrom nonleaf\\nnode vto its “inorder successor” leaf, that is, the path that starts at v, goes to the\\nright child of v, and then goes down leftward until it reaches a leaf. Although,\\nπvis not necessarily the path followed by the down-heap bubbling step from v,\\nthe length ∥πv∥(its number of edges) is proportional to the height of the subtree\\nrooted at v, and thus a bound on the complexity of the down-heap operation at v.\\nWe can bound the total running time of the bottom-up heap construction algorithm\\nbased on the sum of the sizes of paths, ∑v∥πv∥. For intuition, Figure 9.6 illustrates\\nthe justiﬁcation “visually,” marking each edge with the label of the nonleaf node v\\nwhose path πvcontains that edge.\\nWe claim that the paths πvfor all nonleaf vare edge-disjoint, and thus the sum\\nof the path lengths is bounded by the number of total edges in the tree, hence O(n).\\nTo show this, we consider what we term “right-leaning” and “left-leaning” edges\\n(i.e., those going from a parent to a right, respectively left, child). A particular right-\\nleaning edge ecan only be part of the path πvfor node vthat is the parent in the\\nrelationship represented by e. Left-leaning edges can be partitioned by considering\\nthe leaf that is reached if continuing down leftward until reaching a leaf. Eachnonleaf node only uses left-leaning edges in the group leading to that nonleaf node’s\\ninorder successor. Since each nonleaf node must have a different inorder successor,\\nno two such paths can contain the same left-leaning edge.

Priority Queues\\n9.3.7 Python’s heapq Module\\nPython’s standard distribution includes a heapq module that provides support for\\nheap-based priority queues. That module does not provide any priority queue class;\\ninstead it provides functions that allow a standard Python list to be managed as a\\nheap. Its model is essentially the same as our own, with nelements stored in list\\ncells L[0]through L[n−1], based on the level-numbering indices with the small-\\nest element at the root in L[0]. We note that heapq does not separately manage\\nassociated values; elements serve as their own key.\\nTheheapq module supports the following functions, all of which presume that\\nexisting list Lsatisﬁes the heap-order property prior to the call:\\nheappush(L, e) :Push element eonto list Land restore the heap-order\\nproperty. The function executes in O(logn)time.\\nheappop(L) :Pop and return the element with smallest value from list L,\\nand reestablish the heap-order property. The operation\\nexecutes in O(logn)time.\\nheappushpop(L, e) :Push element eon list Land then pop and return the\\nsmallest item. The time is O(logn), but it is slightly more\\nefﬁcient than separate calls to push andpopbecause the\\nsize of the list never changes. If the newly pushed el-ement becomes the smallest, it is immediately returned.\\nOtherwise, the new element takes the place of the popped\\nelement at the root and a down-heap is performed.\\nheapreplace(L, e) :Similar to heappushpop , but equivalent to the pop be-\\ning performed before the push (in other words, the newelement cannot be returned as the smallest). Again, thetime is O(logn), but it is more efﬁcient that two separate\\noperations.\\nThe module supports additional functions that operate on sequences that do not\\npreviously satisfy the heap-order property.\\nheapify(L) :T\\nransform unordered list to satisfy the heap-order prop-\\nerty.

Sorting with a Priority Queue 385\\n9.4 Sorting with a Priority Queue\\nIn deﬁning the priority queue ADT, we noted that any type of object can be used as\\na key, but that any pair of keys must be comparable to each other, and that the set\\nof keys be naturally ordered. In Python, it is common to rely on the <operator to\\ndeﬁne such an order, in which case the following properties must be satisﬁed:\\n•Irreﬂexive property :k̸<k.\\n•Transitive property :i fk1<k2andk2<k3,t h e n k1<k3.\\nFormally, such a relationship deﬁnes what is known as a strict weak order ,a si t\\nallows for keys to be considered equal to each other, but the broader equivalence\\nclasses are totally ordered , as they can be uniquely arranged from smallest to largest\\ndue to the transitive property.\\nAs our ﬁrst application of priority queues, we demonstrate how they can be\\nused to sort a collection Cof comparable elements. That is, we can produce a\\nsequence of elements of Cin increasing order (or at least in nondecreasing order if\\nthere are duplicates). The algorithm is quite simple—we insert all elements into an\\ninitially empty priority queue, and then we repeatedly call remove\\n minto retrieve\\nthe elements in nondecreasing order.\\nAn implementation of this algorithm is given in Code Fragment 9.7, assuming\\nthatCis a positional list. (See Chapter 7.4.) We use an original element of the\\ncollection as both a key and value when calling P.add(element, element) .\\n1defpq\\nsort(C):\\n2”””Sort a collection of elements stored in a positional list.”””\\n3n=l e n ( C )\\n4P = PriorityQueue()\\n5forjinrange(n):\\n6 element = C.delete(C.ﬁrst())\\n7 P.add(element, element) # use element as key and value\\n8forjinrange(n):\\n9 (k,v) = P.remove\\n min()\\n10 C.add\\n last(v) # store smallest remaining element in C\\nCode Fragment 9.7: An implementation of the pq\\nsortfunction, assuming an ap-\\npropriate implementation of a PriorityQueue class.

Suppose that we have an application in which we have a\\nlist of strings that are all known to represent integral values (e.g.,\\n 12\\n), and our\\ngoal is to sort the strings according to those integral values.\\nIn Python, the standard approach for customizing the order for a sorting algo-\\nrithm is to provide, as an optional parameter to the sorting function, an object that\\nis itself a one-parameter function that computes a key for a given element. (See\\nSections 1.5 and 1.10 for a discussion of this approach in the context of the built-\\ninmax function.) For example, with a list of (numeric) strings, we might wish\\nto use the value of int(s) as a key for a string sof the list. In this case, the con-\\nstructor for the intclass can serve as the one-parameter function for computing a\\nkey. In that way, the string\\n 4\\nwill be ordered before string\\n 12\\nbecause its key\\nint(\\n 4\\n)<int(\\n 12\\n). We leave it as an exercise to support such an optional key\\nparameter for the pq\\nsortfunction.

In Phase 2, the running time of each\\nremove\\n minoperation is proportional to the size of P. Thus, the bottleneck com-\\nputation is the repeated “selection” of the minimum element in Phase 2. For thisreason, this algorithm is better known as selection-sort .( S e eF i g u r e9 . 7 . )\\nAs noted above, the bottleneck is in Phase 2 where we repeatedly remove an\\nentry with smallest key from the priority queue P. The size of Pstarts at nand\\nincrementally decreases with each remove\\nminuntil it becomes 0. Thus, the ﬁrst\\noperation takes time O(n), the second one takes time O(n−1), and so on. There-\\nfore, the total time needed for the second phase is\\nO(n+(n−1)+···+2+1)=O(∑n\\ni=1i).\\nBy Proposition 3.3, we have ∑ni=1i=n(n+1)/2.

Priority Queues\\n9.4.2 Heap-Sort\\nAs we have previously observed, realizing a priority queue with a heap has the\\nadvantage that all the methods in the priority queue ADT run in logarithmic time orbetter. Hence, this realization is suitable for applications where fast running timesare sought for all the priority queue methods. Therefore, let us again consider thepq\\nsortscheme, this time using a heap-based implementation of the priority queue.\\nDuring Phase 1, the ithaddoperation takes O(logi)time, since the heap has i\\nentries after the operation is performed. Therefore this phase takes O(nlogn)time.\\n(It could be improved to O(n)with the bottom-up heap construction described in\\nSection 9.3.6.)\\nDuring the second phase of pq\\nsort,t h e jthremove\\n min operation runs in\\nO(log (n−j+1)), since the heap has n−j+1 entries at the time the operation\\nis performed. Summing over all j, this phase takes O(nlogn)time, so the entire\\npriority-queue sorting algorithm runs in O(nlogn)time when we use a heap to im-\\nplement the priority queue. This sorting algorithm is better known as heap-sort ,\\nand its performance is summarized in the following proposition.\\nProposition 9.4: The heap-sort algorithm sorts a collection Cofnelements in\\nO(nlogn)time, assuming two elements of Ccan be compared in O(1)time.\\nLet us stress that the O(nlogn)running time of heap-sort is considerably better\\nthan the O(n2)running time of selection-sort and insertion-sort (Section 9.4.1).\\nImplementing Heap-Sort In-Place\\nIf the collection Cto be sorted is implemented by means of an array-based se-\\nquence, most notably as a Python list, we can speed up heap-sort and reduce its\\nspace requirement by a constant factor using a portion of the list itself to store the\\nheap, thus avoiding the use of an auxiliary heap data structure. This is accomplished\\nby modifying the algorithm as follows:\\n1. We redeﬁne the heap operations to be a maximum-oriented heap, with each\\nposition’s key being at least as large as its children. This can be done by\\nrecoding the algorithm, or by adjusting the notion of keys to be negativelyoriented. At any time during the execution of the algorithm, we use the left\\nportion of C, up to a certain index i−1, to store the entries of the heap, and\\nthe right portion of C, from index iton−1, to store the elements of the\\nsequence. Thus, the ﬁrst ielements of C(at indices 0 ,..., i−1) provide the\\narray-list representation of the heap.\\n2. In the ﬁrst phase of the algorithm, we start with an empty heap and move the\\nboundary between the heap and the sequence from left to right, one step at a\\ntime. In step i,f o r i=1,..., n, we expand the heap by adding the element at\\nindex i−1.'),\n",

Priority Queues\\n9.5 Adaptable Priority Queues\\nThe methods of the priority queue ADT given in Section 9.1.2 are sufﬁcient for\\nmost basic applications of priority queues, such as sorting. However, there aresituations in which additional methods would be useful, as shown by the scenariosbelow involving the standby airline passenger application.\\n•A standby passenger with a pessimistic attitude may become tired of waitingand decide to leave ahead of the boarding time, requesting to be removedfrom the waiting list. Thus, we would like to remove from the priority queuethe entry associated with this passenger. Operation remove\\nmin does not\\nsufﬁce since the passenger leaving does not necessarily have ﬁrst priority.\\nInstead, we want a new operation, remove , that removes an arbitrary entry.\\n•Another standby passenger ﬁnds her gold frequent-ﬂyer card and shows it tothe agent. Thus, her priority has to be modiﬁed accordingly. To achieve this\\nchange of priority, we would like to have a new operation update allowing\\nus to replace the key of an existing entry with a new key.\\nWe will see another application of adaptable priority queues when implementing\\ncertain graph algorithms in Sections 14.6.2 and 14.7.1.\\nIn this section, we develop an adaptable priority queue ADT and demonstrate\\nhow to implement this abstraction as an extension to our heap-based priority queue.\\n9.5.1 Locators\\nIn order to implement methods update andremove efﬁciently, we need a mecha-\\nnism for ﬁnding a user’s element within a priority queue that avoids performing a\\nlinear search through the entire collection. To support our goal, when a new ele-\\nment is added to the priority queue, we return a special object known as a locator to\\nthe caller. We then require the user to provide an appropriate locator as a parameter\\nwhen invoking the update orremove method, as follows, for a priority queue P:\\nP.update(loc, k, v) :Replace key and value for the item identiﬁed by locator loc.\\nP.remove(loc) :Remove the item identiﬁed by locator locfrom the priority\\nqueue and return its (key,value) pair.\\nThe locator abstraction is somewhat akin to the Position abstraction used in our\\npositional list ADT from Section 7.4, and our tree ADT from Chapter 8. However,we differentiate between a locator and a position because a locator for a priorityqueue does not represent a tangible placement of an element within the structure.In our priority queue, an element may be relocated within our data structure duringan operation that does not seem directly relevant to that element. A locator for an\\nitem will remain valid, as long as that item remains somewhere in the queue.'),\n",

Adaptable Priority Queues 391\\n9.5.2 Implementing an Adaptable Priority Queue\\nIn this section, we provide a Python implementation of an adaptable priority queue\\nas an extension of our HeapPriorityQueue class from Section 9.3.4. To implement a\\nLocator class, we will extend the existing\\n Item composite to add an additional ﬁeld\\ndesignating the current index of the element within the array-based representation\\nof our heap, as shown in Figure 9.10.\\n01234567token\\n(15,K,3) (16,X,7) (9,F,4) (5,A,1) (20,B,6) (6,Z,2) (7,Q,5) (4,C,0)\\nFigure 9.10: Representing a heap using a sequence of locators. The third element\\nof each locator instance corresponds to the index of the item within the array. Iden-tiﬁertoken is presumed to be a locator reference in the user’s scope.\\nThe list is a sequence of references to locator instances, each of which stores a\\nkey, value, and the current index of the item within the list. The user will be givena reference to the Locator instance for each inserted element, as portrayed by the\\ntoken identiﬁer in Figure 9.10.\\nWhen we perform priority queue operations on our heap, and items are relo-\\ncated within our structure, we reposition the locator instances within the list and we\\nupdate the third ﬁeld of each locator to reﬂect its new index within the list. As an ex-\\nample, Figure 9.11 shows the state of the above heap after a call to remove\\nmin() .\\nThe heap operation caused the minimum entry, (4,C) , to be removed, and the en-\\ntry,(16,X) , to be temporarily moved from the last position to the root, followed by\\na down-heap bubble phase. During the down-heap, element (16,X) was swapped\\n1234567 0token\\n(9,F,1) (16,X,4) (7,Q,5) (15,K,3) (20,B,6) (6,Z,2) (5,A,0)\\nFigure 9.11: The result of a call to remove\\n min() on the heap originally portrayed\\nin Figure 9.10. Identiﬁer token continues to reference the same locator instance\\nas in the original conﬁguration, but the placement of that locator in the list haschanged, as has the third ﬁeld of the locator.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Michel T.Goodrich ,Roberto Tamassia, Michel H.Gold wasser, Data Structures and Algorithms in Python.pdf', 'page': 413}, page_content='392 Chapter 9. Priority Queues\\nwith its left child, (5,A) , at index 1 of the list, then swapped with its right child,\\n(9,F) , at index 4 of the list. In the ﬁnal conﬁguration, the locator instances for all\\naffected elements have been modiﬁed to reﬂect their new location.\\nIt is important to emphasize that the locator instances have not changed iden-\\ntity. The user’s token reference, portrayed in Figures 9.10 and 9.11, continues to\\nreference the same instance; we have simply changed the third ﬁeld of that instance,\\nand we have changed where that instance is referenced within the list sequence.\\nWith this new representation, providing the additional support for the adaptable\\npriority queue ADT is rather straightforward. When a locator instance is sent as a\\nparameter to update orremove , we may rely on the third ﬁeld of that structure to\\ndesignate where the element resides in the heap. With that knowledge, the updateof a key may simply require an up-heap or down-heap bubbling step to reestablish\\nthe heap-order property. (The complete binary tree property remains intact.) To\\nimplement the removal of an arbitrary element, we move the element at the lastposition to the vacated location, and again perform an appropriate bubbling step tosatisfy the heap-order property.\\nPython Implementation\\nCode Fragments 9.8 and 9.9 present a Python implementation of an adaptable pri-ority queue, as a subclass of the HeapPriorityQueue class from Section 9.3.4. Our\\nmodiﬁcations to the original class are relatively minor. We deﬁne a public Locator\\nclass that inherits from the nonpublic\\nItem class and augments it with an addi-\\ntional\\n index ﬁeld. We make it a public class because we will be using locators\\nas return values and parameters; however, the public interface for the locator class\\ndoes not include any other functionality for the user.\\nTo update locators during the ﬂow of our heap operations, we rely on an inten-\\ntional design decision that our original class uses a nonpublic\\n swap method for all\\ndata movement. We override that utility to execute the additional step of updating\\nthe stored indices within the two swapped locator instances.\\nWe provide a new\\n bubble utility that manages the reinstatement of the heap-\\norder property when a key has changed at an arbitrary position within the heap,either due to a key update, or the blind replacement of a removed element with theitem from the last position of the tree. The\\nbubble utility determines whether to\\napply up-heap or down-heap bubbling, depending on whether the given locationhas a parent with a smaller key. (If an updated key coincidentally remains valid for\\nits current location, we technically call\\ndownheap but no swaps result.)\\nThe public methods are provided in Code Fragment 9.9. The existing add\\nmethod is overridden, both to make use of a Locator instance rather than an\\n Item\\ninstance for storage of the new element, and to return the locator to the caller. The\\nremainder of that method is similar to the original, with the management of locator\\nindices enacted by the use of the new version of\\n swap . There is no reason to over-'),\n",

Adaptable Priority Queues 393\\nride the remove\\n minmethod because the only change in behavior for the adaptable\\npriority queue is again provided by the overridden\\n swap method.\\nTheupdate andremove methods provide the core new functionality for the\\nadaptable priority queue. We perform robust checking of the validity of a locator\\nthat is sent by a caller (although in the interest of space, our displayed code doesnot do preliminary type-checking to ensure that the parameter is indeed a Locator\\ninstance). To ensure that a locator is associated with a current element of the givenpriority queue, we examine the index that is encapsulated within the locator object,and then verify that the entry of the list at that index is the very same locator.\\nIn conclusion, the adaptable priority queue provides the same asymptotic efﬁ-\\nciency and space usage as the nonadaptive version, and provides logarithmic per-formance for the new locator-based update andremove methods.

Your simulator must output the\\nname of the job running on the CPU in each time slice and must process\\na sequence of commands, one per time slice, each of which is of the form“add job name with length nand priority p” or “no new job this slice”.\\nP-9.58 Develop a Python implementation of an adaptable priority queue that isbased on an unsorted list and supports location-aware entries.\\nChapter Notes\\nKnuth’s book on sorting and searching [65] describes the motivation and history for the\\nselection-sort, insertion-sort, and heap-sort algorithms.

Maps, Hash Tables, and Skip Lists\\n10.1 Maps and Dictionaries\\nPython’s dict class is arguably the most signiﬁcant data structure in the language. It\\nrepresents an abstraction known as a dictionary in which unique keys are mapped\\nto associated values . Because of the relationship they express between keys and\\nvalues, dictionaries are commonly known as associative arrays ormaps .I n t h i s\\nbook, we use the term dictionary when speciﬁcally discussing Python’s dictclass,\\nand the term map when discussing the more general notion of the abstract data type.\\nAs a simple example, Figure 10.1 illustrates a map from the names of countries\\nto their associated units of currency.\\nRupeeTurkey Spain China United States India Greece\\nLira Euro Yuan Dollar\\nFigure 10.1: A map from countries (the keys) to their units of currency (the values).\\nWe note that the keys (the country names) are assumed to be unique, but the values\\n(the currency units) are not necessarily unique. For example, we note that Spain\\nand Greece both use the euro for currency. Maps use an array-like syntax for in-dexing, such as currency[\\nGreece\\n ]to access a value associated with a given key\\norcurrency[\\n Greece\\n ]=\\n Drachma\\n to remap it to a new value. Unlike a stan-\\ndard array, indices for a map need not be consecutive nor even numeric. Common\\napplications of maps include the following.\\n•A university’s information system relies on some form of a student ID as a\\nkey that is mapped to that student’s associated record (such as the student’s\\nname, address, and course grades) serving as the value.\\n•The domain-name system (DNS) maps a host name, such as www.wiley.com,\\nto an Internet-Protocol (IP) address, such as 208.215.179.146.\\n•A social media site typically relies on a (nonnumeric) username as a key thatcan be efﬁciently mapped to a particular user’s associated information.\\n•A computer graphics system may map a color name, such as\\nturquoise\\n ,\\nto the triple of numbers that describes the color’s RGB (red-green-blue) rep-resentation, such as (64,224,208) .\\n•Python uses a dictionary to represent each namespace, mapping an identifyingstring, such as\\npi\\n, to an associated object, such as 3.14159 .\\nIn this chapter and the next we demonstrate that a map may be implemented so\\nthat a search for a key, and its associated value, can be performed very efﬁciently,thereby supporting fast lookup in such applications.'),\n",

We begin by listing what we consider the\\nmost signiﬁcant ﬁve behaviors of a map Mas follows:\\nM[k] :Return the value vassociated with key kin map M,i f\\none exists; otherwise raise a KeyError . In Python, this is\\nimplemented with the special method\\n getitem\\n .\\nM[k] = v :Associate value vwith key kin map M, replacing the ex-\\nisting value if the map already contains an item with key\\nequal to k. In Python, this is implemented with the special\\nmethod\\n setitem\\n .\\ndel M[k] :Remove from map Mthe item with key equal to k;i fM\\nhas no such item, then raise a KeyError . In Python, this is\\nimplemented with the special method\\n delitem\\n .\\nlen(M) :Return the number of items in map M. In Python, this is\\nimplemented with the special method\\n len\\n .\\niter(M) :The default iteration for a map generates a sequence of\\nkeys in the map. In Python, this is implemented with the\\nspecial method\\n iter\\n , and it allows loops of the form,\\nforkinM.\\nWe have highlighted the above ﬁve behaviors because they demonstrate the corefunctionality of a map—namely, the ability to query, add, modify, or delete a key-value pair, and the ability to report all such pairs. For additional convenience,map Mshould also support the following behaviors:\\nki nM :Return True if the map contains an item with key k.I n\\nPython, this is implemented with the special\\ncontains\\nmethod.\\nM.get(k, d=None) :Return M[k] if key kexists in the map; otherwise return\\ndefault value d. This provides a form to query M[k] with-\\nout risk of a KeyError .\\nM.setdefault(k, d) :If key kexists in the map, simply return M[k] ;i fk e y k\\ndoes not exist, set M[k] = d and return that value.\\nM.pop(k, d=None) :Remove the item associated with key kfrom the map and\\nreturn its associated value v.I f k e y kis not in the map,\\nreturn default value d(or raise KeyError if parameter dis\\nNone ).'),\n",

This is a standard task when performing a\\nstatistical analysis of a document, for example, when categorizing an email or news\\narticle. A map is an ideal data structure to use here, for we can use words as keysand word counts as values. We show such an application in Code Fragment 10.1.\\nWe break apart the original document using a combination of ﬁle and string\\nmethods that results in a loop over a lowercased version of all whitespace separatedpieces of the document. We omit all nonalphabetic characters so that parentheses,\\napostrophes, and other such punctuation are not considered part of a word.\\nIn terms of map operations, we begin with an empty Python dictionary named\\nfreq. During the ﬁrst phase of the algorithm, we execute the command\\nf r e q [ w o r d ]=1+f r e q . g e t ( w o r d ,0 )\\nfor each word occurrence. We use the getmethod on the right-hand side because the\\ncurrent word might not exist in the dictionary; the default value of 0 is appropriatein that case.\\nDuring the second phase of the algorithm, after the full document has been pro-\\ncessed, we examine the contents of the frequency map, looping over freq.items()\\nto determine which word has the most occurrences.\\n1freq = {}\\n2forpieceinopen(ﬁlename).read().lower().split():\\n3# only consider alphabetic characters within this piece\\n4word =\\n.join(c forcinpieceifc.isalpha())\\n5ifword: # require at least one alphabetic character\\n6 f r e q [ w o r d ]=1+f r e q . g e t ( w o r d ,0 )\\n7\\n8max\\nword =\\n9max\\ncount = 0\\n10for(w,c)infreq.items(): # (key, value) tuples represent (word, count)\\n11ifc>max\\ncount:\\n12 max\\nword = w\\n13 max\\ncount = c\\n14print(\\n The most frequent word is\\n ,m a x\\n word)\\n15print(\\n Its number of occurrences is\\n ,m a x\\n count)\\nCode Fragment 10.1: A program for counting word frequencies in a document, and\\nreporting the most frequent word.

Maps, Hash Tables, and Skip Lists\\n10.1.3 Python’s MutableMapping Abstract Base Class\\nSection 2.4.3 provides an introduction to the concept of an abstract base class\\nand the role of such classes in Python’s collections module. Methods that are de-\\nclared to be abstract in such a base class must be implemented by concrete sub-\\nclasses. However, an abstract base class may provide concrete implementation of\\nother methods that depend upon use of the presumed abstract methods. (This is an\\nexample of the template method design pattern .)\\nThecollections module provides two abstract base classes that are relevant to\\nour current discussion: the Mapping andMutableMapping classes. The Mapping\\nclass includes all nonmutating methods supported by Python’s dictclass, while the\\nMutableMapping class extends that to include the mutating methods. What we\\ndeﬁne as the map ADT in Section 10.1.1 is akin to the MutableMapping abstract\\nbase class in Python’s collections module.\\nThe signiﬁcance of these abstract base classes is that they provide a framework\\nto assist in creating a user-deﬁned map class. In particular, the MutableMapping\\nclass provides concrete implementations for all behaviors other than the ﬁrst ﬁve\\noutlined in Section 10.1.1:\\n getitem\\n ,\\nsetitem\\n ,\\ndelitem\\n ,\\nlen\\n ,a n d\\niter\\n . As we implement the map abstraction with various data structures, as\\nlong as we provide the ﬁve core behaviors, we can inherit all other derived behav-iors by simply declaring MutableMapping as a parent class.\\nTo better understand the MutableMapping class, we provide a few examples of\\nhow concrete behaviors can be derived from the ﬁve core abstractions. For example,the\\ncontains\\n method, supporting the syntax ki nM , could be implemented by\\nmaking a guarded attempt to retrieve self[k] to determine if the key exists.\\ndef\\n contains\\n (self,k ) :\\ntry:\\nself[k] # access via\\n getitem\\n (ignore result)\\nreturn True\\nexcept KeyError:\\nreturn False # attempt failed\\nA similar approach might be used to provide the logic of the setdefault method.\\ndefsetdefault( self,k ,d ) :\\ntry:\\nreturn self [k] #i f\\n getitem\\n succeeds, return value\\nexcept KeyError: #o t h e r w i s e :\\nself[k] = d # set default value with\\n setitem\\nreturn d # and return that newly assigned value\\nWe leave as exercises the implementations of the remaining concrete methods of\\ntheMutableMapping class.'),\n",

Figure 10.2 provides a preview of those\\nclasses.\\nTheMutableMapping abstract base class, from Python’s collections module\\nand discussed in the preceding pages, is a valuable tool when implementing a map.\\nHowever, in the interest of greater code reuse, we deﬁne our own MapBase class,\\nwhich is itself a subclass of the MutableMapping class. Our MapBase class pro-\\nvides additional support for the composition design pattern. This is a technique\\nwe introduced when implementing a priority queue (see Section 9.2.1) in order to\\ngroup a key-value pair as a single instance for internal use.\\nMore formally, our MapBase class is deﬁned in Code Fragment 10.2, extend-\\ning the existing MutableMapping abstract base class so that we inherit the many\\nuseful concrete methods that class provides. We then deﬁne a nonpublic nested\\nItem class, whose instances are able to store both a key and value. This nested\\nclass is reasonably similar in design to the\\n Item class that was deﬁned within our\\nPriorityQueueBase class in Section 9.2.1, except that for a map we provide sup-\\nport for both equality tests and comparisons, both of which rely on the item’s key.The notion of equality is necessary for all of our map implementations, as a way to\\ndetermine whether a key given as a parameter is equivalent to one that is already\\nstored in the map. The notion of comparisons between keys, using the <operator,\\nwill become relevant when we later introduce a sorted map ADT (Section 10.3).\\nProbeHashMapMutableMapping\\n(Section 10.1.4)MapBase\\n(Section 10.3.1)SortedTableMap\\n(Chapter 11)TreeMap\\n(Section 10.2.4)HashMapBase\\n(Section 10.2.4)ChainHashMap\\n(Section 10.2.4)(collections module)\\n(Section 10.1.5)UnsortedTableMap\\n(additional subclasses)\\nFigure 10.2: Our hierarchy of map types (with references to where they are deﬁned).'),\n",

Maps, Hash Tables, and Skip Lists\\n10.2 Hash Tables\\nIn this section, we introduce one of the most practical data structures for imple-\\nmenting a map, and the one that is used by Python’s own implementation of the\\ndictclass. This structure is known as a hash table .\\nIntuitively, a map Msupports the abstraction of using keys as indices with a\\nsyntax such as M[k] . As a mental warm-up, consider a restricted setting in which\\na map with nitems uses keys that are known to be integers in a range from 0 to\\nN−1f o rs o m e N≥n. In this case, we can represent the map using a lookup table\\nof length N, as diagrammed in Figure 10.3.\\n0 123456789 1 0\\nDZ C Q\\nFigure 10.3: A lookup table with length 11 for a map containing items (1,D), (3,Z),\\n(6,C), and (7,Q).\\nIn this representation, we store the value associated with key kat index kof the\\ntable (presuming that we have a distinct way to represent an empty slot). Basic mapoperations of\\ngetitem\\n ,\\nsetitem\\n ,a n d\\n delitem\\n can be implemented in\\nO(1)worst-case time.\\nThere are two challenges in extending this framework to the more general set-\\nting of a map. First, we may not wish to devote an array of length Nif it is the case\\nthatN≫n. Second, we do not in general require that a map’s keys be integers.\\nThe novel concept for a hash table is the use of a hash function to map general\\nkeys to corresponding indices in a table. Ideally, keys will be well distributed in therange from 0 to N−1 by a hash function, but in practice there may be two or more\\ndistinct keys that get mapped to the same index. As a result, we will conceptualize\\nour table as a bucket array , as shown in Figure 10.4, in which each bucket may\\nmanage a collection of items that are sent to a speciﬁc index by the hash function.\\n(To save space, an empty bucket may be replaced by None .)\\n0 123456789 1 0\\n(1,D) (25,C)\\n(3,F)\\n(14,Z)(39,C)(6,A) (7,Q)\\nFigure 10.4: A bucket array of capacity 11 with items (1,D), (25,C), (3,F), (14,Z),\\n(6,A), (39,C), and (7,Q), using a simple hash function.'),\n",

Hash Tables 411\\n10.2.1 Hash Functions\\nThe goal of a hash function ,h, is to map each key kto an integer in the range\\n[0,N−1],w h e r e Nis the capacity of the bucket array for a hash table. Equipped\\nwith such a hash function, h, the main idea of this approach is to use the hash\\nfunction value, h(k), as an index into our bucket array, A, instead of the key k\\n(which may not be appropriate for direct use as an index). That is, we store the\\nitem (k,v)in the bucket A[h(k)].\\nIf there are two or more keys with the same hash value, then two different items\\nwill be mapped to the same bucket in A. In this case, we say that a collision has\\noccurred. To be sure, there are ways of dealing with collisions, which we willdiscuss later, but the best strategy is to try to avoid them in the ﬁrst place. We saythat a hash function is “good” if it maps the keys in our map so as to sufﬁcientlyminimize collisions. For practical reasons, we also would like a hash function to\\nbe fast and easy to compute.\\nIt is common to view the evaluation of a hash function, h(k), as consisting of\\ntwo portions—a hash code that maps a key kto an integer, and a compression\\nfunction that maps the hash code to an integer within a range of indices, [0,N−1],\\nfor a bucket array.

This allows the development of a general hash code for each object that canbe used for a hash table of any size; only the compression function depends uponthe table size.

Maps, Hash Tables, and Skip Lists\\nHash Codes\\nThe ﬁrst action that a hash function performs is to take an arbitrary key kin our\\nmap and compute an integer that is called the hash code fork; this integer need not\\nbe in the range [0,N−1], and may even be negative. We desire that the set of hash\\ncodes assigned to our keys should avoid collisions as much as possible. For if the\\nhash codes of our keys cause collisions, then there is no hope for our compression\\nfunction to avoid them. In this subsection, we begin by discussing the theory ofhash codes. Following that, we discuss practical implementations of hash codes inPython.\\nTreating the Bit Representation as an Integer\\nTo begin, we note that, for any data type Xthat is represented using at most as many\\nbits as our integer hash codes, we can simply take as a hash code for Xan integer\\ninterpretation of its bits. For example, the hash code for key 314 could simply be\\n314. The hash code for a ﬂoating-point number such as 3 .14 could be based upon\\nan interpretation of the bits of the ﬂoating-point representation as an integer.\\nFor a type whose bit representation is longer than a desired hash code, the above\\nscheme is not immediately applicable. For example, Python relies on 32-bit hash\\ncodes. If a ﬂoating-point number uses a 64-bit representation, its bits cannot be\\nviewed directly as a hash code. One possibility is to use only the high-order 32 bits\\n(or the low-order 32 bits). This hash code, of course, ignores half of the informationpresent in the original key, and if many of the keys in our map only differ in thesebits, then they will collide using this simple hash code.\\nA better approach is to combine in some way the high-order and low-order por-\\ntions of a 64-bit key to form a 32-bit hash code, which takes all the original bitsinto consideration. A simple implementation is to add the two components as 32-bit numbers (ignoring overﬂow), or to take the exclusive-or of the two components.These approaches of combining components can be extended to any object xwhose\\nbinary representation can be viewed as an n-tuple (x\\n0,x1,..., xn−1)of 32-bit inte-\\ngers, for example, by forming a hash code for xas∑n−1\\ni=0xi,o ra s x0⊕x1⊕···⊕ xn−1,\\nwhere the ⊕symbol represents the bitwise exclusive-or operation (which is ˆin\\nPython).\\nPolynomial Hash Codes\\nThe summation and exclusive-or hash codes, described above, are not good choicesfor character strings or other variable-length objects that can be viewed as tuples ofthe form (x\\n0,x1,..., xn−1), where the order of the xi’s is signiﬁcant. For example,\\nconsider a 16-bit hash code for a character string sthat sums the Unicode values\\nof the characters in s. This hash code unfortunately produces lots of unwanted'),\n",

A better\\nhash code should somehow take into consideration the positions of the xi’s. An\\nalternative hash code, which does exactly this, is to choose a nonzero constant,\\na̸=1, and use as a hash code the value\\nx0an−1+x1an−2+···+xn−2a+xn−1.\\nMathematically speaking, this is simply a polynomial in athat takes the compo-\\nnents (x0,x1,..., xn−1)of an object xas its coefﬁcients. This hash code is therefore\\ncalled a polynomial hash code . By Horner’s rule (see Exercise C-3.50), this poly-\\nnomial can be computed as\\nxn−1+a(xn−2+a(xn−3+···+a(x2+a(x1+ax0))···)).\\nIntuitively, a polynomial hash code uses multiplication by different powers as a\\nway to spread out the inﬂuence of each component across the resulting hash code.\\nOf course, on a typical computer, evaluating a polynomial will be done using\\nthe ﬁnite bit representation for a hash code; hence, the value will periodically over-ﬂow the bits used for an integer. Since we are more interested in a good spread ofthe object xwith respect to other keys, we simply ignore such overﬂows. Still, we\\nshould be mindful that such overﬂows are occurring and choose the constant aso\\nthat it has some nonzero, low-order bits, which will serve to preserve some of theinformation content even as we are in an overﬂow situation.\\nWe have done some experimental studies that suggest that 33, 37, 39, and 41\\nare particularly good choices for awhen working with character strings that are\\nEnglish words. In fact, in a list of over 50,000 English words formed as the unionof the word lists provided in two variants of Unix, we found that taking ato be 33,\\n37, 39, or 41 produced less than 7 collisions in each case!\\nCyclic-Shift Hash Codes\\nA variant of the polynomial hash code replaces multiplication by awith a cyclic\\nshift of a partial sum by a certain number of bits. For example, a 5-bit cyclic shiftof the 32-bit value 00111\\n101100101101010100010101000 is achieved by taking\\nthe leftmost ﬁve bits and placing those on the rightmost side of the representation,resulting in 10110010110101010001010100000111\\n. While this operation has little\\nnatural meaning in terms of arithmetic, it accomplishes the goal of varying the bitsof the calculation. In Python, a cyclic shift of bits can be accomplished throughcareful use of the bitwise operators <<and>>, taking care to truncate results to\\n32-bit integers.'),\n",

Hash Tables 415\\nHash Codes in Python\\nThe standard mechanism for computing hash codes in Python is a built-in function\\nwith signature hash(x) that returns an integer value that serves as the hash code for\\nobject x. However, only immutable data types are deemed hashable in Python. This\\nrestriction is meant to ensure that a particular object’s hash code remains constant\\nduring that object’s lifespan. This is an important property for an object’s use as\\na key in a hash table. A problem could occur if a key were inserted into the hashtable, yet a later search were performed for that key based on a different hash codethan that which it had when inserted; the wrong bucket would be searched.\\nAmong Python’s built-in data types, the immutable int,ﬂoat ,str,tuple ,a n d\\nfrozenset classes produce robust hash codes, via the hash function, using tech-\\nniques similar to those discussed earlier in this section. Hash codes for characterstrings are well crafted based on a technique similar to polynomial hash codes,except using exclusive-or computations rather than additions. If we repeat the ex-periment described in Table 10.1 using Python’s built-in hash codes, we ﬁnd thatonly 8 strings out of the set of more than 230,000 collide with another. Hash codes\\nfor tuples are computed with a similar technique based upon a combination of the\\nhash codes of the individual elements of the tuple. When hashing a frozenset ,t h e\\norder of the elements should be irrelevant, and so a natural option is to compute theexclusive-or of the individual hash codes without any shifting. If hash(x) is called\\nfor an instance xof a mutable type, such as a list,aTypeError is raised.\\nInstances of user-deﬁned classes are treated as unhashable by default, with a\\nTypeError raised by the hash function. However, a function that computes hash\\ncodes can be implemented in the form of a special method named\\nhash\\n within\\na class. The returned hash code should reﬂect the immutable attributes of an in-stance. It is common to return a hash code that is itself based on the computed hashof the combination of such attributes. For example, a Color class that maintains\\nthree numeric red, green, and blue components might implement the method as:\\ndef\\nhash\\n (self):\\nreturn hash( ( self.\\nred,self.\\ngreen, self.\\nblue) ) # hash combined tuple\\nAn important rule to obey is that if a class deﬁnes equivalence through\\n eq\\n ,\\nthen any implementation of\\n hash\\n must be consistent, in that if x= =y ,t h e n\\nhash(x) == hash(y) . This is important because if two instances are considered\\nto be equivalent and one is used as a key in a hash table, a search for the secondinstance should result in the discovery of the ﬁrst. It is therefore important that thehash code for the second match the hash code for the ﬁrst, so that the proper bucketis examined. This rule extends to any well-deﬁned comparisons between objectsof different classes. For example, since Python treats the expression 5= =5 . 0 as\\ntrue, it ensures that hash(5) andhash(5.0) are the same.'),\n",

Maps, Hash Tables, and Skip Lists\\nCompression Functions\\nThe hash code for a key kwill typically not be suitable for immediate use with a\\nbucket array, because the integer hash code may be negative or may exceed the ca-\\npacity of the bucket array. Thus, once we have determined an integer hash code for\\na key object k, there is still the issue of mapping that integer into the range [0,N−1].\\nThis computation, known as a compression function , is the second action per-\\nformed as part of an overall hash function. A good compression function is one\\nthat minimizes the number of collisions for a given set of distinct hash codes.\\nThe Division Method\\nA simple compression function is the division method , which maps an integer ito\\nimod N,\\nwhere N, the size of the bucket array, is a ﬁxed positive integer. Additionally, if we\\ntake Nto be a prime number, then this compression function helps “spread out” the\\ndistribution of hashed values. Indeed, if Nis not prime, then there is greater risk\\nthat patterns in the distribution of hash codes will be repeated in the distribution ofhash values, thereby causing collisions. For example, if we insert keys with hash\\ncodes {200,205,210,215,220,..., 600}into a bucket array of size 100, then each\\nhash code will collide with three others. But if we use a bucket array of size 101,\\nthen there will be no collisions. If a hash function is chosen well, it should ensurethat the probability of two different keys getting hashed to the same bucket is 1 /N.\\nChoosing Nto be a prime number is not always enough, however, for if there is\\na repeated pattern of hash codes of the form pN +qfor several different p’s, then\\nthere will still be collisions.\\nThe MAD Method\\nA more sophisticated compression function, which helps eliminate repeated pat-terns in a set of integer keys, is the Multiply-Add-and-Divide (or “MAD”) method.\\nThis method maps an integer ito\\n[(ai+b)mod p]mod N,\\nwhere Nis the size of the bucket array, pis a prime number larger than N,a n d a\\nandbare integers chosen at random from the interval [0,p−1], with a>0. This\\ncompression function is chosen in order to eliminate repeated patterns in the set ofhash codes and get us closer to having a “good” hash function, that is, one such thatthe probability any two different keys collide is 1 /N. This good behavior would be\\nthe same as we would have if these keys were “thrown” into Auniformly at random.'),\n",

Hash Tables 417\\n10.2.2 Collision-Handling Schemes\\nThe main idea of a hash table is to take a bucket array, A, and a hash function, h,a n d\\nuse them to implement a map by storing each item (k,v)in the “bucket” A[h(k)].\\nThis simple idea is challenged, however, when we have two distinct keys, k1andk2,\\nsuch that h(k1)=h(k2). The existence of such collisions prevents us from simply\\ninserting a new item (k,v)directly into the bucket A[h(k)]. It also complicates our\\nprocedure for performing insertion, search, and deletion operations.\\nSeparate Chaining\\nA simple and efﬁcient way for dealing with collisions is to have each bucket A[j]\\nstore its own secondary container, holding items (k,v)such that h(k)=j. A natural\\nchoice for the secondary container is a small map instance implemented using a list,\\nas described in Section 10.1.5. This collision resolution rule is known as separate\\nchaining , and is illustrated in Figure 10.6.\\nA123456789 1 0 01 112\\n123825\\n9054\\n28413618 10\\nFigure 10.6: A hash table of size 13, storing 10 items with integer keys, with colli-\\nsions resolved by separate chaining. The compression function is h(k)=kmod 13.\\nFor simplicity, we do not show the values associated with the keys.\\nIn the worst case, operations on an individual bucket take time proportional to\\nthe size of the bucket. Assuming we use a good hash function to index the nitems\\nof our map in a bucket array of capacity N, the expected size of a bucket is n/N.\\nTherefore, if given a good hash function, the core map operations run in O(⌈n/N⌉).\\nThe ratio λ=n/N, called the load factor of the hash table, should be bounded by\\na small constant, preferably below 1. As long as λisO(1), the core operations on\\nthe hash table run in O(1)expected time.'),\n",

Maps, Hash Tables, and Skip Lists\\nOpen Addressing\\nThe separate chaining rule has many nice properties, such as affording simple im-\\nplementations of map operations, but it nevertheless has one slight disadvantage:\\nIt requires the use of an auxiliary data structure—a list—to hold items with collid-ing keys. If space is at a premium (for example, if we are writing a program for asmall handheld device), then we can use the alternative approach of always storingeach item directly in a table slot. This approach saves space because no auxiliary\\nstructures are employed, but it requires a bit more complexity to deal with colli-\\nsions. There are several variants of this approach, collectively referred to as open\\naddressing schemes, which we discuss next. Open addressing requires that the load\\nfactor is always at most 1 and that items are stored directly in the cells of the bucket\\narray itself.\\nLinear Probing and Its Variants\\nA simple method for collision handling with open addressing is linear probing .\\nWith this approach, if we try to insert an item (k,v)into a bucket A[j]that is already\\noccupied, where j=h(k), then we next try A[(j+1)mod N].I fA[(j+1)mod N]\\nis also occupied, then we try A[(j+2)mod N], and so on, until we ﬁnd an empty\\nbucket that can accept the new item. Once this bucket is located, we simply in-\\nsert the item there. Of course, this collision resolution strategy requires that wechange the implementation when searching for an existing key—the ﬁrst step of all\\ngetitem\\n ,\\nsetitem\\n ,o r\\n delitem\\n operations. In particular, to attempt\\nto locate an item with key equal to k, we must examine consecutive slots, starting\\nfrom A[h(k)], until we either ﬁnd an item with that key or we ﬁnd an empty bucket.\\n(See Figure 10.7.) The name “linear probing” comes from the fact that accessing acell of the bucket array can be viewed as a “probe.”\\n26123456789 1 0 0New element with\\nkey = 15 to be insertedMust probe 4 times\\nbefore ﬁnding empty slot\\n53 7 1 6 2 1 13\\nFigure 10.7: Insertion into a hash table with integer keys using linear probing.

Hash Tables 419\\nTo implement a deletion, we cannot simply remove a found item from its slot\\nin the array. For example, after the insertion of key 15 portrayed in Figure 10.7,\\nif the item with key 37 were trivially deleted, a subsequent search for 15 wouldfail because that search would start by probing at index 4, then index 5, and thenindex 6, at which an empty cell is found. A typical way to get around this difﬁ-culty is to replace a deleted item with a special “available” marker object. With\\nthis special marker possibly occupying spaces in our hash table, we modify our\\nsearch algorithm so that the search for a key kwill skip over cells containing the\\navailable marker and continue probing until reaching the desired item or an emptybucket (or returning back to where we started from). Additionally, our algorithm\\nfor\\nsetitem\\n should remember an available cell encountered during the search\\nfork, since this is a valid place to put a new item (k,v), if no existing item is found.\\nAlthough use of an open addressing scheme can save space, linear probing\\nsuffers from an additional disadvantage. It tends to cluster the items of a map intocontiguous runs, which may even overlap (particularly if more than half of the cells\\nin the hash table are occupied). Such contiguous runs of occupied hash cells causesearches to slow down considerably.\\nAnother open addressing strategy, known as quadratic probing , iteratively tries\\nthe buckets A[(h(k)+f(i))mod N],f o ri=0,1,2,...,w h e r e f(i)=i\\n2, until ﬁnding\\nan empty bucket. As with linear probing, the quadratic probing strategy compli-cates the removal operation, but it does avoid the kinds of clustering patterns thatoccur with linear probing. Nevertheless, it creates its own kind of clustering, calledsecondary clustering , where the set of ﬁlled array cells still has a non-uniform\\npattern, even if we assume that the original hash codes are distributed uniformly.When Nis prime and the bucket array is less than half full, the quadratic probing\\nstrategy is guaranteed to ﬁnd an empty slot. However, this guarantee is not validonce the table becomes at least half full, or if Nis not chosen as a prime number;\\nwe explore the cause of this type of clustering in an exercise (C-10.36).\\nAn open addressing strategy that does not cause clustering of the kind produced\\nby linear probing or the kind produced by quadratic probing is the double hashing\\nstrategy. In this approach, we choose a secondary hash function, h\\n′,a n di f hmaps\\nsome key kto a bucket A[h(k)]that is already occupied, then we iteratively try\\nthe buckets A[(h(k)+f(i))mod N]next, for i=1,2,3,...,w h e r e f(i)=i·h′(k).\\nIn this scheme, the secondary hash function is not allowed to evaluate to zero; acommon choice is h\\n′(k)=q−(kmod q), for some prime number q<N.A l s o , N\\nshould be a prime.\\nAnother approach to avoid clustering with open addressing is to iteratively try\\nbuckets A[(h(k)+f(i))mod N]where f(i)is based on a pseudo-random number\\ngenerator, providing a repeatable, but somewhat arbitrary, sequence of subsequentprobes that depends upon bits of the original hash code. This is the approach cur-\\nrently used by Python’s dictionary class.'),\n",

Maps, Hash Tables, and Skip Lists\\n10.2.3 Load Factors, Rehashing, and Eﬃciency\\nIn the hash table schemes described thus far, it is important that the load factor,\\nλ=n/N, be kept below 1. With separate chaining, as λgets very close to 1, the\\nprobability of a collision greatly increases, which adds overhead to our operations,\\nsince we must revert to linear-time list-based methods in buckets that have col-\\nlisions. Experiments and average-case analyses suggest that we should maintainλ<0.9 for hash tables with separate chaining.\\nWith open addressing, on the other hand, as the load factor λgrows beyond 0 .5\\nand starts approaching 1, clusters of entries in the bucket array start to grow as well.These clusters cause the probing strategies to “bounce around” the bucket array fora considerable amount of time before they ﬁnd an empty slot. In Exercise C-10.36,we explore the degradation of quadratic probing when λ≥0.5. Experiments sug-\\ngest that we should maintain λ<0.5 for an open addressing scheme with linear\\nprobing, and perhaps only a bit higher for other open addressing schemes (for ex-ample, Python’s implementation of open addressing enforces that λ<2/3).\\nIf an insertion causes the load factor of a hash table to go above the speciﬁed\\nthreshold, then it is common to resize the table (to regain the speciﬁed load factor)\\nand to reinsert all objects into this new table. Although we need not deﬁne a new\\nhash code for each object, we do need to reapply a new compression function thattakes into consideration the size of the new table. Each rehashing will generally\\nscatter the items throughout the new bucket array. When rehashing to a new table, itis a good requirement for the new array’s size to be at least double the previous size.\\nIndeed, if we always double the size of the table with each rehashing operation, then\\nwe can amortize the cost of rehashing all the entries in the table against the timeused to insert them in the ﬁrst place (as with dynamic arrays; see Section 5.3).\\nEﬃciency of Hash Tables\\nAlthough the details of the average-case analysis of hashing are beyond the scopeof this book, its probabilistic basis is quite intuitive. If our hash function is good,then we expect the entries to be uniformly distributed in the Ncells of the bucket\\narray. Thus, to store nentries, the expected number of keys in a bucket would\\nbe⌈n/N⌉,w h i c hi s O(1)ifnisO(N).\\nThe costs associated with a periodic rehashing, to resize a table after occasional\\ninsertions or deletions can be accounted for separately, leading to an additional\\nO(1)amortized cost for\\nsetitem\\n and\\n getitem\\n .\\nIn the worst case, a poor hash function could map every item to the same bucket.\\nThis would result in linear-time performance for the core map operations with sepa-\\nrate chaining, or with any open addressing model in which the secondary sequenceof probes depends only on the hash code. A summary of these costs is given in\\nTable 10.2.'),\n",

Python’s dictclass is implemented with hashing, and\\nthe Python interpreter relies on dictionaries to retrieve an object that is referenced\\nby an identiﬁer in a given namespace. (See Sections 1.10 and 2.5.) The basic com-mand c=a+b involves two calls to\\ngetitem\\n in the dictionary for the local\\nnamespace to retrieve the values identiﬁed as aandb, and a call to\\n setitem\\nto store the result associated with name cin that namespace. In our own algorithm\\nanalysis, we simply presume that such dictionary operations run in constant time,independent of the number of entries in the namespace. (Admittedly, the numberof entries in a typical namespace can almost surely be bounded by a constant.)\\nIn a 2003 academic paper [31], researchers discuss the possibility of exploiting\\na hash table’s worst-case performance to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) attackof Internet technologies. For many published algorithms that compute hash codes,\\nthey note that an attacker could precompute a very large number of moderate-length\\nstrings that all hash to the identical 32-bit hash code. (Recall that by any of thehashing schemes we describe, other than double hashing, if two keys are mappedto the same hash code, they will be inseparable in the collision resolution.)\\nIn late 2011, another team of researchers demonstrated an implementation of\\njust such an attack [61]. Web servers allow a series of key-value parameters to beembedded in a URL using a syntax such as ?key1=val1&key2=val2&key3=val3 .\\nTypically, those key-value pairs are immediately stored in a map by the server,\\nand a limit is placed on the length and number of such parameters presuming that\\nstorage time in the map will be linear in the number of entries. If all keys wereto collide, that storage requires quadratic time (causing the server to perform aninordinate amount of work). In spring of 2012, Python developers distributed asecurity patch that introduces randomization into the computation of hash codes\\nfor strings, making it less tractable to reverse engineer a set of colliding strings.'),\n",

Maps, Hash Tables, and Skip Lists\\n10.2.4 Python Hash Table Implementation\\nIn this section, we develop two implementations of a hash table, one using sepa-\\nrate chaining and the other using open addressing with linear probing. While theseapproaches to collision resolution are quite different, there are a great many com-monalities to the hashing algorithms. For that reason, we extend the MapBase\\nclass (from Code Fragment 10.2), to deﬁne a new HashMapBase class (see Code\\nFragment 10.4), providing much of the common functionality to our two hash tableimplementations. The main design elements of the HashMapBase class are:\\n•The bucket array is represented as a Python list, named self.\\ntable , with all\\nentries initialized to None .\\n•We maintain an instance variable self.\\nnthat represents the number of dis-\\ntinct items that are currently stored in the hash table.\\n•If the load factor of the table increases beyond 0 .5, we double the size of the\\ntable and rehash all items into the new table.\\n•We deﬁne a\\n hash\\nfunction utility method that relies on Python’s built-in\\nhash function to produce hash codes for keys, and a randomized Multiply-\\nAdd-and-Divide (MAD) formula for the compression function.\\nWhat is not implemented in the base class is any notion of how a “bucket”\\nshould be represented.

Sorted Maps 427\\n10.3 Sorted Maps\\nThe traditional map ADT allows a user to look up the value associated with a given\\nkey, but the search for that key is a form known as an exact search .\\nFor example, computer systems often maintain information about events that\\nhave occurred (such as ﬁnancial transactions), organizing such events based upon\\nwhat are known as time stamps . If we can assume that time stamps are unique\\nfor a particular system, then we might organize a map with a time stamp servingas the key, and a record about the event that occurred at that time as the value. Aparticular time stamp could serve as a reference ID for an event, in which case wecan quickly retrieve information about that event from the map. However, the mapADT does not provide any way to get a list of all events ordered by the time at\\nwhich they occur, or to search for which event occurred closest to a particular time.\\nIn fact, the fast performance of hash-based implementations of the map ADT relieson the intentionally scattering of keys that may seem very “near” to each other inthe original domain, so that they are more uniformly distributed in a hash table.\\nIn this section, we introduce an extension known as the sorted map ADT that\\nincludes all behaviors of the standard map, plus the following:\\nM.ﬁnd\\nmin() :Return the (key,value) pair with minimum key(orNone , if map is empty).\\nM.ﬁnd\\nmax() :Return the (key,value) pair with maximum key\\n(orNone , if map is empty).\\nM.ﬁnd\\n lt(k) :Return the (key,value) pair with the greatest key that\\nis strictly less than k(orNone ,i fn os u c hi t e me x i s t s ) .\\nM.ﬁnd\\n le(k) :Return the (key,value) pair with the greatest key thatis less than or equal to k(orNone ,i fn os u c hi t e m\\nexists).\\nM.ﬁnd\\ngt(k) :Return the (key,value) pair with the least key that isstrictly greater than k(orNone ,i fn os u c hi t e me x i s t s ) .\\nM.ﬁnd\\nge(k) :Return the (key,value) pair with the least key that isgreater than or equal to k(orNone ,i fn os u c hi t e m ) .\\nM.ﬁnd\\nrange(start, stop) :Iterate all (key,value) pairs with start<=k e y <stop.\\nIfstart isNone , iteration begins with minimum key; if\\nstop isNone , iteration concludes with maximum key.\\niter(M) :Iterate all keys of the map according to their natural\\norder, from smallest to largest.\\nreversed(M) :Iterate all keys of the map in reverse order; in Python,\\nthis is implemented with the\\n reversed\\n method.'),\n",

Maps, Hash Tables, and Skip Lists\\n10.3.1 Sorted Search Tables\\nSeveral data structures can efﬁciently support the sorted map ADT, and we will\\nexamine some advanced techniques in Section 10.4 and Chapter 11. In this section,we begin by exploring a simple implementation of a sorted map. We store themap’s items in an array-based sequence Aso that they are in increasing order of\\ntheir keys, assuming the keys have a naturally deﬁned order. (See Figure 10.8.) We\\nrefer to this implementation of a map as a sorted search table .\\n9 2 4 5 7 8 12 14 17 19 22 25 27 28 335\\n3701234 6789 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5\\nFigure 10.8: Realization of a map by means of a sorted search table. We show only\\nthe keys for this map, so as to highlight their ordering.\\nAs was the case with the unsorted table map of Section 10.1.5, the sorted search\\ntable has a space requirement that is O(n), assuming we grow and shrink the array\\nto keep its size proportional to the number of items in the map. The primary advan-\\ntage of this representation, and our reason for insisting that Abe array-based, is that\\nit allows us to use the binary search algorithm for a variety of efﬁcient operations.\\nBinary Search and Inexact Searches\\nWe originally presented the binary search algorithm in Section 4.1.3, as a means for\\ndetecting whether a given target is stored within a sorted sequence. In our original\\npresentation (Code Fragment 4.3 on page 156), a binary\\n search function returned\\nTrue ofFalse to designate whether the desired target was found. While such an\\napproach could be used to implement the\\n contains\\n method of the map ADT,\\nwe can adapt the binary search algorithm to provide far more useful information\\nwhen performing forms of inexact search in support of the sorted map ADT.\\nThe important realization is that while performing a binary search, we can de-\\ntermine the index at or near where a target might be found. During a successful\\nsearch, the standard implementation determines the precise index at which the tar-\\nget is found. During an unsuccessful search, although the target is not found, the\\nalgorithm will effectively determine a pair of indices designating elements of thecollection that are just less than or just greater than the missing target.\\nAs a motivating example, our original simulation from Figure 4.5 on page 156\\nshows a successful binary search for a target of 22, using the same data we portrayin Figure 10.8. Had we instead been searching for 21, the ﬁrst four steps of thealgorithm would be the same. The subsequent difference is that we would make anadditional call with inverted parameters high=9 andlow=10 , effectively conclud-\\ning that the missing target lies in the gap between values 19 and 22 in that example.'),\n",

Sorted Maps 429\\nImplementation\\nIn Code Fragments 10.8 through 10.10, we present a complete implementation of a\\nclass,SortedTableMap , that supports the sorted map ADT. The most notable fea-\\nture of our design is the inclusion of a\\n ﬁnd\\nindex utility function. This method\\nusing the binary search algorithm, but by convention returns the index of the left-\\nmost item in the search interval having key greater than or equal to k. Therefore, if\\nthe key is present, it will return the index of the item having that key. (Recall thatkeys are unique in a map.) When the key is missing, the function returns the index\\nof the item in the search interval that is just beyond where the key would have beenlocated. As a technicality, the method returns index high +1 to indicate that no\\nitems of the interval had a key greater than k.\\nWe rely on this utility method when implementing the traditional map opera-\\ntions and the new sorted map operations. The body of each of the\\ngetitem\\n ,\\nsetitem\\n ,a n d\\n delitem\\n methods begins with a call to\\n ﬁnd\\nindex to deter-\\nmine a candidate index at which a matching key might be found. For\\n getitem\\n ,\\nwe simply check whether that is a valid index containing the target to determine theresult. For\\nsetitem\\n , recall that the goal is to replace the value of an existing\\nitem, if one with key kis found, but otherwise to insert a new item into the map. The\\nindex returned by\\n ﬁnd\\nindex will be the index of the match, if one exists, or oth-\\nerwise the exact index at which the new item should be inserted. For\\n delitem\\n ,\\nwe again rely on the convenience of\\n ﬁnd\\nindex to determine the location of the\\nitem to be popped, if any.\\nOur\\nﬁnd\\nindex utility is equally valuable when implementing the various in-\\nexact search methods given in Code Fragment 10.10. For each of the methodsﬁnd\\nlt,ﬁnd\\nle,ﬁnd\\ngt,a n dﬁnd\\nge, we begin with a call to\\n ﬁnd\\nindex utility,\\nwhich locates the ﬁrst index at which there is an element with key ≥k,i fa n y .T h i s\\nis precisely what we want for ﬁnd\\nge, if valid, and just beyond the index we want\\nforﬁnd\\nlt.F o rﬁnd\\ngtandﬁnd\\nlewe need some extra case analysis to distinguish\\nwhether the indicated index has a key equal to k. For example, if the indicated\\nitem has a matching key, our ﬁnd\\ngtimplementation increments the index before\\ncontinuing with the process. (We omit the implementation of ﬁnd\\nle, for brevity.)\\nIn all cases, we must properly handle boundary cases, reporting None when unable\\nto ﬁnd a key with the desired property.\\nOur strategy for implementing ﬁnd\\nrange is to use the\\n ﬁnd\\nindex utility to\\nlocate the ﬁrst item with key ≥start (assuming start is notNone ). With that knowl-\\nedge, we use a while loop to sequentially report items until reaching one that hasa key greater than or equal to the stopping value (or until reaching the end of thetable). It is worth noting that the while loop may trivially iterate zero items if theﬁrst key that is greater than or equal to start also happens to be greater than or equal\\ntostop. This represents an empty range in the map.'),\n",

Sorted Maps 433\\nAnalysis\\nWe conclude by analyzing the performance of our SortedTableMap implementa-\\ntion. A summary of the running times for all methods of the sorted map ADT\\n(including the traditional map operations) is given in Table 10.3. It should be clear\\nthat the\\n len\\n ,ﬁnd\\nmin,a n dﬁnd\\nmax methods run in O(1)time, and that iter-\\nating the keys of the table in either direction can be peformed in O(n)time.\\nThe analysis for the various forms of search all depend on the fact that a binary\\nsearch on a table with nentries runs in O(logn)time. This claim was originally\\nshown as Proposition 4.2 in Section 4.2, and that analysis clearly applies to our\\nﬁnd\\nindex method as well. We therefore claim an O(logn)worst-case running\\ntime for methods\\n getitem\\n ,ﬁnd\\nlt,ﬁnd\\ngt,ﬁnd\\nle,a n dﬁnd\\nge. Each of these\\nmakes a single call to\\n ﬁnd\\nindex , followed by a constant number of additional\\nsteps to determine the appropriate answer based on the index. The analysis ofﬁnd\\nrange is a bit more interesting. It begins with a binary search to ﬁnd the ﬁrst\\nitem within the range (if any). After that, it executes a loop that takes O(1)time per\\niteration to report subsequent values until reaching the end of the range.

Maps, Hash Tables, and Skip Lists\\n10.3.2 Two Applications of Sorted Maps\\nIn this section, we explore applications in which there is particular advantage to\\nusing a sorted map rather than a traditional (unsorted) map. To apply a sorted\\nmap, keys must come from a domain that is totally ordered. Furthermore, to take\\nadvantage of the inexact or range searches afforded by a sorted map, there should\\nbe some reason why nearby keys have relevance to a search.\\nFlight Databases\\nThere are several Web sites on the Internet that allow users to perform queries onﬂight databases to ﬁnd ﬂights between various cities, typically with the intent to\\nbuy a ticket. To make a query, a user speciﬁes origin and destination cities, a depar-\\nture date, and a departure time. To support such queries, we can model the ﬂightdatabase as a map, where keys are Flight objects that contain ﬁelds corresponding\\nto these four parameters. That is, a key is a tuple\\nk=(origin,destination ,date,time ).\\nAdditional information about a ﬂight, such as the ﬂight number, the number of seatsstill available in ﬁrst (F) and coach (Y) class, the ﬂight duration, and the fare, can\\nbe stored in the value object.\\nFinding a requested ﬂight is not simply a matter of ﬁnding an exact match\\nfor a requested query. Although a user typically wants to exactly match the ori-\\ngin and destination cities, he or she may have ﬂexibility for the departure date,and certainly will have some ﬂexibility for the departure time on a speciﬁc day.\\nWe can handle such a query by ordering our keys lexicographically. Then, an ef-\\nﬁcient implementation for a sorted map would be a good way to satisfy users’queries. For instance, given a user query key k, we could call ﬁnd\\nge(k) to return\\nthe ﬁrst ﬂight between the desired cities, having a departure date and time match-ing the desired query or later. Better yet, with well-constructed keys, we could\\nuseﬁnd\\nrange(k1, k2) to ﬁnd all ﬂights within a given range of times. For exam-\\nple, if k1=(ORD, PVD, 05May, 09:30 ),a n d k2=(ORD, PVD, 05May, 20:00 ),\\na respective call to ﬁnd\\nrange(k1, k2) might result in the following sequence of\\nkey-value pairs:\\n(ORD, PVD, 05May, 09:53 ):( AA 1840, F5, Y15, 02:05,\\n 251),\\n(ORD, PVD, 05May, 13:29 ):( AA 600, F2, Y0, 02:16,\\n 713),\\n(ORD, PVD, 05May, 17:39 ):( AA 416, F3, Y9, 02:09,\\n 365),\\n(ORD, PVD, 05May, 19:50 ):( AA 1828, F9, Y25, 02:13,\\n 186)'),\n",

Suppose, for the sake of an example, we are interested\\nin maintaining a database rating automobiles by their maximum speeds and their\\ncost. We would like to allow someone with a certain amount of money to query ourdatabase to ﬁnd the fastest car they can possibly afford.\\nWe can model such a trade-off problem as this by using a key-value pair to\\nmodel the two parameters that we are trading off, which in this case would be thepair (cost,speed )for each car. Notice that some cars are strictly better than other\\ncars using this measure. For example, a car with cost-speed pair (20000,100 )is\\nstrictly better than a car with cost-speed pair (30000,90). At the same time, there\\nare some cars that are not strictly dominated by another car. For example, a car withcost-speed pair (20000,100 )may be better or worse than a car with cost-speed pair\\n(30000,120 ), depending on how much money we have to spend. (See Figure 10.9.)\\nFigure 10.9: Illustrating the cost-performance trade-off with pairs represented by\\npoints in the plane.

A pair (a,b)is called a maximum pair if it is not dominated by any\\nother pair. We are interested in maintaining the set of maxima of a collection ofcost-performance pairs.

Skip Lists 437\\n10.4 Skip Lists\\nAn interesting data structure for realizing the sorted map ADT is the skip list .I n\\nSection 10.3.1, we saw that a sorted array will allow O(logn)-time searches via the\\nbinary search algorithm. Unfortunately, update operations on a sorted array have\\nO(n)worst-case running time because of the need to shift elements. In Chapter 7\\nwe demonstrated that linked lists support very efﬁcient update operations, as long\\nas the position within the list is identiﬁed. Unfortunately, we cannot perform fastsearches on a standard linked list; for example, the binary search algorithm requires\\nan efﬁcient means for direct accessing an element of a sequence by index.\\nSkip lists provide a clever compromise to efﬁciently support search and update\\noperations. A skip list Sfor a map Mconsists of a series of lists {S\\n0,S1,..., Sh}.\\nEach list Sistores a subset of the items of Msorted by increasing keys, plus items\\nwith two sentinel keys denoted −∞ and +∞,w h e r e −∞ is smaller than every\\npossible key that can be inserted in Mand +∞is larger than every possible key\\nthat can be inserted in M. In addition, the lists in Ssatisfy the following:\\n•List S0contains every item of the map M(plus sentinels −∞ and +∞).\\n•For i=1,..., h−1, list Sicontains (in addition to −∞ and +∞) a randomly\\ngenerated subset of the items in list Si−1.\\n•List Shcontains only −∞ and +∞.\\nAn example of a skip list is shown in Figure 10.10. It is customary to visualize a\\nskip list Swith list S0at the bottom and lists S1,..., Shabove it. Also, we refer to h\\nas the height of skip list S.\\nIntuitively, the lists are set up so that Si+1contains more or less alternate items\\nofSi. As we shall see in the details of the insertion method, the items in Si+1are\\nchosen at random from the items in Siby picking each item from Sito also be in\\nSi+1with probability 1 /2.

In other words, we expect the height hofSto be about log n. The halving of\\nthe number of items from one list to the next is not enforced as an explicit property\\nof skip lists, however. Instead, randomization is used.\\nFunctions that generate numbers that can be viewed as random numbers are\\nbuilt into most modern computers, because they are used extensively in computergames, cryptography, and computer simulations, Some functions, called pseudo-\\nrandom number generators , generate random-like numbers, starting with an initial\\nseed. (See discusion of random module in Section 1.11.1.) Other methods use\\nhardware devices to extract “true” random numbers from nature. In any case, wewill assume that our computer has access to numbers that are sufﬁciently randomfor our analysis.\\nThe main advantage of using randomization in data structure and algorithm\\ndesign is that the structures and functions that result are usually simple and efﬁcient.\\nThe skip list has the same logarithmic time bounds for searching as is achieved by\\nthe binary search algorithm, yet it extends that performance to update methodswhen inserting or deleting items. Nevertheless, the bounds are expected for the\\nskip list, while binary search has a worst-case bound with a sorted table.\\nA skip list makes random choices in arranging its structure in such a way that\\nsearch and update times are O(logn)on average ,w h e r e nis the number of items\\nin the map. Interestingly, the notion of average time complexity used here does notdepend on the probability distribution of the keys in the input. Instead, it dependson the use of a random-number generator in the implementation of the insertions\\nto help decide where to place the new item. The running time is averaged over all\\npossible outcomes of the random numbers used when inserting entries.\\nUsing the position abstraction used for lists and trees, we view a skip list as a\\ntwo-dimensional collection of positions arranged horizontally into levels and ver-\\ntically into towers . Each level is a list S\\niand each tower contains positions storing\\nthe same item across consecutive lists. The positions in a skip list can be traversedusing the following operations:\\nnext(p) :Return the position following pon the same level.\\nprev(p) :Return the position preceding pon the same level.\\nbelow(p) :Return the position below pin the same tower.\\nabove(p) :Return the position above pin the same tower.\\nWe conventionally assume that the above operations return None if the position\\nrequested does not exist. Without going into the details, we note that we can eas-ily implement a skip list by means of a linked structure such that the individualtraversal methods each take O(1)time, given a skip-list position p. Such a linked\\nstructure is essentially a collection of hdoubly linked lists aligned at towers, which\\nare also doubly linked lists.'),\n",

Skip Lists 439\\n10.4.1 Search and Update Operations in a Skip List\\nThe skip-list structure affords simple map search and update algorithms. In fact,\\nall of the skip-list search and update algorithms are based on an elegant SkipSearch\\nmethod that takes a key kand ﬁnds the position pof the item in list S0that has the\\nlargest key less than or equal to k(which is possibly −∞).\\nSearching in a Skip List\\nSuppose we are given a search key k. We begin the SkipSearch method by setting\\na position variable pto the topmost, left position in the skip list S, called the start\\nposition ofS. That is, the start position is the position of Shstoring the special\\nentry with key −∞. We then perform the following steps (see Figure 10.11), where\\nkey (p)denotes the key of the item at position p:\\n1. If S.below (p)isNone , then the search terminates—we are at the bottom and\\nhave located the item in Swith the largest key less than or equal to the search\\nkey k. Otherwise, we drop down to the next lower level in the present tower\\nby setting p=S.below (p).\\n2. Starting at position p, we move pforward until it is at the rightmost position\\non the present level such that key (p)≤k. We call this the scan forward step.\\nNote that such a position always exists, since each level contains the keys+∞and−∞. It may be that premains where it started after we perform\\nsuch a forward scan for this level.\\n3.

After inserting\\nthe new item at the bottom level, we use randomization to decide the height of the\\ntower for the new item. We “ﬂip” a coin, and if the ﬂip comes up tails, then we stop\\nhere. Else (the ﬂip comes up heads), we backtrack to the previous (next higher)\\nlevel and insert (k,v)in this level at the appropriate position. We again ﬂip a coin;\\nif it comes up heads, we go to the next higher level and repeat.

Maps, Hash Tables, and Skip Lists\\nRemoval in a Skip List\\nLike the search and insertion algorithms, the removal algorithm for a skip list is\\nquite simple. In fact, it is even easier than the insertion algorithm. That is, to per-\\nform the map operation del M[k] we begin by executing method SkipSearch (k).\\nIf the position pstores an entry with key different from k, we raise a KeyError .\\nOtherwise, we remove pand all the positions above p, which are easily accessed\\nby using above operations to climb up the tower of this entry in Sstarting at posi-\\ntion p. While removing levels of the tower, we reestablish links between the hor-\\nizontal neighbors of each removed position. The removal algorithm is illustratedin Figure 10.13 and a detailed description of it is left as an exercise (R-10.24). Aswe show in the next subsection, deletion operation in a skip list with nentries has\\nO(logn)expected running time.\\nBefore we give this analysis, however, there are some minor improvements to\\nthe skip-list data structure we would like to discuss. First, we do not actually needto store references to values at the levels of the skip list above the bottom level,because all that is needed at these levels are references to keys. In fact, we can\\nmore efﬁciently represent a tower as a single object, storing the key-value pair,\\nand maintaining jprevious references and jnext references if the tower reaches\\nlevel S\\nj. Second, for the horizontal axes, it is possible to keep the list singly linked,\\nstoring only the next references. We can perform insertions and removals in strictlya top-down, scan-forward fashion. We explore the details of this optimization in\\nExercise C-10.44. Neither of these optimizations improve the asymptotic perfor-\\nmance of skip lists by more than a constant factor, but these improvements can,nevertheless, be meaningful in practice. In fact, experimental evidence suggeststhat optimized skip lists are faster in practice than A VL trees and other balanced\\nsearch trees, which are discussed in Chapter 11.\\n31S5\\nS4\\nS3\\nS2\\nS1-∞-∞\\n-∞ 1212 -∞\\n1717 25\\n25 31\\n3142\\n55 5055+∞\\n+∞+∞\\n+∞\\n+∞-∞-∞\\n17\\n38\\n38 39 424242\\n44\\n445555+∞\\n17\\n17\\n20 2525\\nS0\\nFigure 10.13: Removal of the entry with key 25 from the skip list of Figure 10.12.\\nThe positions visited after the search for the position of S0holding the entry are\\nhighlighted.

Skip Lists 443\\nMaintaining the Topmost Level\\nA skip list Smust maintain a reference to the start position (the topmost, left po-\\nsition in S) as an instance variable, and must have a policy for any insertion that\\nwishes to continue inserting a new entry past the top level of S.T h e r e a r e t w o\\npossible courses of action we can take, both of which have their merits.\\nOne possibility is to restrict the top level, h, to be kept at some ﬁxed value that\\nis a function of n, the number of entries currently in the map (from the analysis we\\nwill see that h=max{10,2⌈logn⌉}is a reasonable choice, and picking h=3⌈logn⌉\\nis even safer). Implementing this choice means that we must modify the insertion\\nalgorithm to stop inserting a new position once we reach the topmost level (unless\\n⌈logn⌉<⌈log (n+1)⌉, in which case we can now go at least one more level, since\\nthe bound on the height is increasing).\\nThe other possibility is to let an insertion continue inserting a new position as\\nlong as heads keeps getting returned from the random number generator. This isthe approach taken by algorithm SkipInsert of Code Fragment 10.13. As we show\\nin the analysis of skip lists, the probability that an insertion will go to a level that ismore than O(logn)is very low, so this design choice should also work.\\nEither choice will still result in the expected O(logn)time to perform search,\\ninsertion, and removal, however, which we show in the next section.\\n10.4.2 Probabilistic Analysis of Skip Lists ⋆\\nAs we have shown above, skip lists provide a simple implementation of a sortedmap. In terms of worst-case performance, however, skip lists are not a superior datastructure. In fact, if we do not ofﬁcially prevent an insertion from continuing signif-icantly past the current highest level, then the insertion algorithm can go into whatis almost an inﬁnite loop (it is not actually an inﬁnite loop, however, since the prob-\\nability of having a fair coin repeatedly come up heads forever is 0). Moreover, we\\ncannot inﬁnitely add positions to a list without eventually running out of memory.In any case, if we terminate position insertion at the highest level h, then the worst-\\ncase running time for performing the\\ngetitem\\n ,\\nsetitem\\n ,a n d\\n delitem\\nmap operations in a skip list Swith nentries and height hisO(n+h). This worst-\\ncase performance occurs when the tower of every entry reaches level h−1, where\\nhis the height of S. However, this event has very low probability. Judging from\\nthis worst case, we might conclude that the skip-list structure is strictly inferior tothe other map implementations discussed earlier in this chapter. But this would not\\nbe a fair analysis, for this worst-case behavior is a gross overestimate.'),\n",

Maps, Hash Tables, and Skip Lists\\nBounding the Height of a Skip List\\nBecause the insertion step involves randomization, a more accurate analysis of skip\\nlists involves a bit of probability. At ﬁrst, this might seem like a major undertaking,\\nfor a complete and thorough probabilistic analysis could require deep mathemat-ics (and, indeed, there are several such deep analyses that have appeared in datastructures research literature). Fortunately, such an analysis is not necessary to un-\\nderstand the expected asymptotic behavior of skip lists. The informal and intuitive\\nprobabilistic analysis we give below uses only basic concepts of probability theory.\\nLet us begin by determining the expected value of the height hof a skip list S\\nwith nentries (assuming that we do not terminate insertions early). The probability\\nthat a given entry has a tower of height i≥1 is equal to the probability of getting i\\nconsecutive heads when ﬂipping a coin, that is, this probability is 1 /2\\ni. Hence, the\\nprobability Pithat level ihas at least one position is at most\\nPi≤n\\n2i,\\nfor the probability that any one of ndifferent events occurs is at most the sum of\\nthe probabilities that each occurs.\\nThe probability that the height hofSis larger than iis equal to the probability\\nthat level ihas at least one position, that is, it is no more than Pi. This means that h\\nis larger than, say, 3log nwith probability at most\\nP3l o g n≤n\\n23l o g n\\n=n\\nn3=1\\nn2.\\nFor example, if n=1000, this probability is a one-in-a-million long shot. More\\ngenerally, given a constant c>1,his larger than clognwith probability at most\\n1/nc−1. That is, the probability that his smaller than clognis at least 1 −1/nc−1.\\nThus, with high probability, the height hofSisO(logn).\\nAnalyzing Search Time in a Skip List\\nNext, consider the running time of a search in skip list S, and recall that such a\\nsearch involves two nested while loops. The inner loop performs a scan forward on\\nal e v e lo f Sas long as the next key is no greater than the search key k, and the outer\\nloop drops down to the next level and repeats the scan forward iteration. Since theheight hofSisO(logn)with high probability, the number of drop-down steps is\\nO(logn)with high probability.'),\n",

Observe that, after\\nthe key at the starting position, each additional key examined in a scan-forward at\\nlevel icannot also belong to level i+1. If any of these keys were on the previous\\nlevel, we would have encountered them in the previous scan-forward step. Thus,the probability that any key is counted in n\\niis 1/2. Therefore, the expected value of\\nniis exactly equal to the expected number of times we must ﬂip a fair coin before\\nit comes up heads. This expected value is 2. Hence, the expected amount of timespent scanning forward at any level iisO(1).S i n c e Shas O(logn)levels with high\\nprobability, a search in Stakes expected time O(logn).

Maps, Hash Tables, and Skip Lists\\n10.5 Sets, Multisets, and Multimaps\\nWe conclude this chapter by examining several additional abstractions that are\\nclosely related to the map ADT, and that can be implemented using data structuressimilar to those for a map.\\n•Asetis an unordered collection of elements, without duplicates, that typi-\\ncally supports efﬁcient membership tests. In essence, elements of a set arelike keys of a map, but without any auxiliary values.\\n•Amultiset (also known as a bag) is a set-like container that allows duplicates.\\n•Amultimap is similar to a traditional map, in that it associates values with\\nkeys; however, in a multimap the same key can be mapped to multiple val-\\nues. For example, the index of this book maps a given term to one or more\\nlocations at which the term occurs elsewhere in the book.\\n10.5.1 The Set ADT\\nPython provides support for representing the mathematical notion of a set throughthe built-in classes frozenset andset, as originally discussed in Chapter 1, with\\nfrozenset being an immutable form. Both of those classes are implemented using\\nhash tables in Python.\\nPython’s collections module deﬁnes abstract base classes that essentially mirror\\nthese built-in classes. Although the choice of names is counterintuitive, the abstractbase class collections.Set matches the concrete frozenset class, while the abstract\\nbase class collections.MutableSet is akin to the concrete setclass.\\nIn our own discussion, we equate the “set ADT” with the behavior of the built-\\ninsetclass (and thus, the collections.MutableSet base class). We begin by listing\\nwhat we consider to be the ﬁve most fundamental behaviors for a set S:\\nS.add(e) :Add element eto the set. This has no effect if the set\\nalready contains e.\\nS.discard(e) :Remove element efrom the set, if present. This has no\\neffect if the set does not contain e.\\nei nS :Return True if the set contains element e. In Python, this\\nis implemented with the special\\ncontains\\n method.\\nlen(S) :Return the number of elements in set S. In Python, this\\nis implemented with the special method\\n len\\n .\\niter(S) :Generate an iteration of all elements of the set.

Those remaining behaviors can be naturally grouped as\\nfollows. We begin by describing the following additional operations for removingone or more elements from a set:\\nS.remove(e) :Remove element efrom the set. If the set does not contain e,\\nraise a KeyError .\\nS.pop() :Remove and return an arbitrary element from the set. If theset is empty, raise a KeyError .\\nS.clear() :Remove all elements from the set.\\nThe next group of behaviors perform Boolean comparisons between two sets.\\nS= =T :Return True if sets SandThave identical contents.\\nS! =T :Return True if sets SandTare not equivalent.\\nS<=T :Return True if setSis a subset of set T.\\nS<T:Return True if setSis a proper subset of set T.\\nS>=T :Return True if setSis a superset of set T.\\nS>T:Return True if setSis a proper superset of set T.\\nS.isdisjoint(T) :Return True if sets SandThave no common elements.\\nFinally, there exists a variety of behaviors that either update an existing set, orcompute a new set instance, based on classical set theory operations.\\nS|T:R\\neturn a new set representing the union of sets SandT.\\nS|=T :Update set Sto be the union of Sand set T.\\nS&T :Return a new set representing the intersection of sets SandT.\\nS& =T :Update set Sto be the intersection of Sand set T.\\nSˆT :Return a new set representing the symmetric difference of setsSandT, that is, a set of elements that are in precisely one of\\nSorT.\\nSˆ =T :Update set Sto become the symmetric difference of itself and\\nsetT.\\nS−T:Return a new set containing elements in Sbut not T.\\nS−=T :Update set Sto remove all common elements with set T.'),\n",

Maps, Hash Tables, and Skip Lists\\n10.5.2 Python’s MutableSet Abstract Base Class\\nTo aid in the creation of user-deﬁned set classes, Python’s collections module pro-\\nvides a MutableSet abstract base class (just as it provides the MutableMapping ab-\\nstract base class discussed in Section 10.1.3). The MutableSet base class provides\\nconcrete implementations for all methods described in Section 10.5.1, except for\\nﬁve core behaviors ( add,discard ,\\ncontains\\n ,\\nlen\\n ,a n d\\n iter\\n ) that must\\nbe implemented by any concrete subclass. This design is an example of what is\\nknown as the template method pattern , as the concrete methods of the MutableSet\\nclass rely on the presumed abstract methods that will subsequently be provided bya subclass.\\nFor the purpose of illustration, we examine algorithms for implementing several\\nof the derived methods of the MutableSet base class. For example, to determine if\\none set is a proper subset of another, we must verify two conditions: a proper subset\\nmust have size strictly smaller than that of its superset, and each element of a subset\\nmust be contained in the superset. An implementation of the corresponding\\nlt\\nmethod based on this logic is given in Code Fragment 10.14.\\ndef\\n lt\\n(self,o t h e r ) : # supports syntax S <T\\n”””Return true if this set is a proper subset of other.”””iflen(self)>= len(other):\\nreturn False # proper subset must have strictly smaller size\\nforein self :\\nifenot in other:\\nreturn False # not a subset since element missing from other\\nreturn True # success; all conditions are met\\nCode Fragment 10.14: A possible implementation of the MutableSet.\\n lt\\nmethod, which tests if one set is a proper subset of another.\\nAs another example, we consider the computation of the union of two sets.\\nThe set ADT includes two forms for computing a union. The syntax S|Tshould\\nproduce a new set that has contents equal to the union of existing sets Sand T.T h i s\\noperation is implemented through the special method\\n or\\n in Python. Another\\nsyntax, S|=T is used to update existing set Sto become the union of itself and\\nset T. Therefore, all elements of Tthat are not already contained in Sshould\\nbe added to S. We note that this “in-place” operation may be implemented more\\nefﬁciently than if we were to rely on the ﬁrst form, using the syntax S=S |T,i n\\nwhich identiﬁer Sis reassigned to a new set instance that represents the union. For\\nconvenience, Python’s built-in set class supports named version of these behaviors,withS.union(T) equivalent to S|T,a n dS.update(T) equivalent to S|=T (yet,\\nthose named versions are not formally provided by the MutableSet abstract base\\nclass).'),\n",

Since the MutableSet class is designed as an abstract base class, instances\\nmust belong to a concrete subclass. When computing the union of two such con-\\ncrete instances, the result should presumably be an instance of the same class as the\\noperands.

Maps, Hash Tables, and Skip Lists\\n10.5.3 Implementing Sets, Multisets, and Multimaps\\nSets\\nAlthough sets and maps have very different public interfaces, they are really quite\\nsimilar. A set is simply a map in which keys do not have associated values. Anydata structure used to implement a map can be modiﬁed to implement the set ADTwith similar performance guarantees. We could trivially adapt any map class by\\nstoring set elements as keys, and using None as an irrelevant value, but such an\\nimplementation is unnecessarily wasteful. An efﬁcient set implementation should\\nabandon the\\nItem composite that we use in our MapBase class and instead store\\nset elements directly in a data structure.\\nMultisets\\nThe same element may occur several times in a multiset. All of the data structureswe have seen can be reimplemented to allow for duplicates to appear as separateelements. However, another way to implement a multiset is by using a map in\\nwhich the map key is a (distinct) element of the multiset, and the associated valueis a count of the number of occurrences of that element within the multiset. In fact,that is essentially what we did in Section 10.1.2 when computing the frequency ofwords within a document.\\nPython’s standard collections module includes a deﬁnition for a class named\\nCounter that is in essence a multiset. Formally, the Counter class is a subclass of\\ndict, with the expectation that values are integers, and with additional functionality\\nlike amost\\ncommon(n) method that returns a list of the nmost common elements.\\nThe standard\\n iter\\n reports each element only once (since those are formally the\\nkeys of the dictionary). There is another method named elements() that iterates\\nthrough the multiset with each element being repeated according to its count.\\nMultimaps\\nAlthough there is no multimap in Python’s standard libraries, a common imple-mentation approach is to use a standard map in which the value associated with akey is itself a container class storing any number of associated values. We give anexample of such a MultiMap class in Code Fragment 10.17. Our implementation\\nuses the standard dictclass as the map, and a list of values as a composite value in\\nthe dictionary. We have designed the class so that a different map implementationcan easily be substituted by overriding the class-level\\nMapType attribute at line 3.'),\n",

Search Trees\\n11.1 Binary Search Trees\\nIn Chapter 8 we introduced the tree data structure and demonstrated a variety of\\napplications. One important use is as a search tree (as described on page 332). In\\nthis chapter, we use a search tree structure to efﬁciently implement a sorted map .\\nThe three most fundamental methods of a map M(see Section 10.1.1) are:\\nM[k] :Return the value vassociated with key kin map M, if one exists;\\notherwise raise a KeyError ; implemented with\\n getitem\\n method.\\nM[k] = v :Associate value vwith key kin map M, replacing the existing value\\nif the map already contains an item with key equal to k; implemented\\nwith\\n setitem\\n method.\\ndel M[k] :Remove from map Mthe item with key equal to k;i fMhas no such\\nitem, then raise a KeyError ; implemented with\\n delitem\\n method.\\nThe sorted map ADT includes additional functionality (see Section 10.3), guar-\\nanteeing that an iteration reports keys in sorted order, and supporting additional\\nsearches such as ﬁnd\\ngt(k) andﬁnd\\nrange(start, stop) .\\nBinary trees are an excellent data structure for storing items of a map, assuming\\nwe have an order relation deﬁned on the keys. In this context, a binary search tree\\nis a binary tree Twith each position pstoring a key-value pair (k,v)such that:\\n•Keys stored in the left subtree of pare less than k.\\n•Keys stored in the right subtree of pare greater than k.\\nAn example of such a binary search tree is given in Figure 11.1. As a matter ofconvenience, we will not diagram the values associated with keys in this chapter,since those values do not affect the placement of items within a search tree.\\n8082 54 28 9365 32 9744\\n88 17\\n8\\n76 29\\nFigure 11.1: A binary search tree with integer keys.

Binary Search Trees 461\\n11.1.1 Navigating a Binary Search Tree\\nWe begin by demonstrating that a binary search tree hierarchically represents the\\nsorted order of its keys. In particular, the structural property regarding the place-ment of keys within a binary search tree assures the following important conse-quence regarding an inorder traversal (Section 8.4.3) of the tree.\\nProposition 11.1:\\nAn inorder traversal of a binary search tree visits positions in\\nincreasing order of their keys.\\nJustiﬁcation: We prove this by induction on the size of a subtree. If a subtree\\nhas at most one item, its keys are trivially visited in order. More generally, an\\ninorder traversal of a (sub)tree consists of a recursive traversal of the (possibly\\nempty) left subtree, followed by a visit of the root, and then a recursive traversal ofthe (possibly empty) right subtree. By induction, a recursive inorder traversal of theleft subtree will produce an iteration of the keys in that subtree in increasing order.\\nFurthermore, by the binary search tree property, all keys in the left subtree have\\nkeys strictly smaller than that of the root. Therefore, visiting the root just after thatsubtree extends the increasing order of keys. Finally, by the search tree property,all keys in the right subtree are strictly greater than the root, and by induction, aninorder traversal of that subtree will visit those keys in increasing order.\\nSince an inorder traversal can be executed in linear time, a consequence of this\\nproposition is that we can produce a sorted iteration of the keys of a map in lineartime, when represented as a binary search tree.\\nAlthough an inorder traversal is typically expressed using a top-down recur-\\nsion, we can provide nonrecursive descriptions of operations that allow more ﬁne-grained navigation among the positions of a binary search relative to the order of\\ntheir keys. Our generic binary tree ADT from Chapter 8 is deﬁned as a positional\\nstructure, allowing direct navigation using methods such as parent(p) ,left(p),a n d\\nright(p) . With a binary search tree, we can provide additional navigation based on\\nthe natural order of the keys stored in the tree. In particular, we can support the\\nfollowing methods, akin to those provided by a PositionalList (Section 7.4.1).\\nﬁrst(): Return the position containing the least key, or None if the tree is empty.\\nlast() :Return the position containing the greatest key, or None if empty tree.\\nbefore(p) :Return the position containing the greatest key that is less than that of\\nposition p(i.e., the position that would be visited immediately before p\\nin an inorder traversal), or None ifpis the ﬁrst position.\\nafter(p) :Return the position containing the least key that is greater than that ofposition p(i.e., the position that would be visited immediately after p\\nin an inorder traversal), or None ifpis the last position.'),\n",

Search Trees\\nThe “ﬁrst” position of a binary search tree can be located by starting a walk at\\nthe root and continuing to the left child, as long as a left child exists. By symmetry,\\nthe last position is reached by repeated steps rightward starting at the root.\\nThe successor of a position, after(p) , is determined by the following algorithm.\\nAlgorithm after(p) :\\nifright(p) is notNone then{successor is leftmost position in p’s right subtree }\\nwalk =right(p)\\nwhile left(walk) is notNone do\\nwalk =left(walk)\\nreturn walk\\nelse{successor is nearest ancestor having pin its left subtree }\\nwalk =p\\nancestor =parent(walk)\\nwhile ancestor is notNone andwalk ==right(ancestor) do\\nwalk =ancestor\\nancestor =parent(walk)\\nreturn ancestor\\nCode Fragment 11.1: Computing the successor of a position in a binary search tree.\\nThe rationale for this process is based purely on the workings of an inorder\\ntraversal, given the correspondence of Proposition 11.1. If phas a right subtree,\\nthat right subtree is recursively traversed immediately after pis visited, and so the\\nﬁrst position to be visited after pis the leftmost position within the right subtree.\\nIfpdoes not have a right subtree, then the ﬂow of control of an inorder traversal\\nreturns to p’s parent. If pwere in the right subtree of that parent, then the parent’s\\nsubtree traversal is complete and the ﬂow of control progresses to its parent andso on. Once an ancestor is reached in which the recursion is returning from itsleftsubtree, then that ancestor becomes the next position visited by the inorder\\ntraversal, and thus is the successor of p. Notice that the only case in which no such\\nancestor is found is when pwas the rightmost (last) position of the full tree, in\\nwhich case there is no successor.\\nA symmetric algorithm can be deﬁned to determine the predecessor of a po-\\nsition, before(p) . At this point, we note that the running time of single call to\\nafter(p) orbefore(p) is bounded by the height hof the full tree, because it is found\\nafter either a single downward walk or a single upward walk. While the worst-caserunning time is O(h), we note that either of these methods run in O(1)amortized\\ntime, in that series of ncalls to after(p) starting at the ﬁrst position will execute in a\\ntotal of O(n)time. We leave a formal justiﬁcation of this fact to Exercise C-11.34,\\nbut intuitively the upward and downward paths mimic steps of the inorder traversal\\n(a related argument was made in the justiﬁcation of Proposition 9.3).'),\n",

Search Trees\\nDeletion\\nDeleting an item from a binary search tree Tis a bit more complex than inserting\\na new item because the location of the deletion might be anywhere in the tree. (In\\ncontrast, insertions are always enacted at the bottom of a path.) To delete an item\\nwith key k, we begin by calling TreeSearch(T, T.root(), k) to ﬁnd the position p\\nofTstoring an item with key equal to k. If the search is successful, we distinguish\\nbetween two cases (of increasing difﬁculty):\\n•Ifphas at most one child, the deletion of the node at position pis easily\\nimplemented. When introducing update methods for the LinkedBinaryTree\\nclass in Section 8.3.1, we declared a nonpublic utility,\\n delete(p) , that deletes\\na node at position pand replaces it with its child (if any), presuming that phas\\nat most one child. That is precisely the desired behavior. It removes the item\\nwith key kfrom the map while maintaining all other ancestor-descendant\\nrelationships in the tree, thereby assuring the upkeep of the binary searchtree property. (See Figure 11.5.)\\n•If position phas two children, we cannot simply remove the node from T\\nsince this would create a “hole” and two orphaned children. Instead, weproceed as follows (see Figure 11.6):\\n◦We locate position rcontaining the item having the greatest key that is\\nstrictly less than that of position p,t h a ti s , r=b e f o r e ( p ) by the notation\\nof Section 11.1.1. Because phas two children, its predecessor is the\\nrightmost position of the left subtree of p.\\n◦We use r’s item as a replacement for the one being deleted at position p.\\nBecause rhas the immediately preceding key in the map, any items in\\np’s right subtree will have keys greater than rand any other items in p’s\\nleft subtree will have keys less than r. Therefore, the binary search tree\\nproperty is satisﬁed after the replacement.\\n◦Having used r’s as a replacement for p, we instead delete the node at\\nposition rfrom the tree. Fortunately, since rwas located as the right-\\nmost position in a subtree, rdoes not have a right child. Therefore, its\\ndeletion can be performed using the ﬁrst (and simpler) approach.\\nAs with searching and insertion, this algorithm for a deletion involves the\\ntraversal of a single path downward from the root, possibly moving an item betweentwo positions of this path, and removing a node from that path and promoting its\\nchild. Therefore, it executes in time O(h)where his the height of the tree.'),\n",

Almost\\nall operations have a worst-case running time that depends on h,w h e r e his the\\nheight of the current tree. This is because most operations rely on a constant amountof work for each node along a particular path of the tree, and the maximum pathlength within a tree is proportional to the height of the tree. Most notably, our\\nimplementations of map operations\\ngetitem\\n ,\\nsetitem\\n ,a n d\\n delitem\\neach begin with a call to the\\n subtree\\n search utility which traces a path downward\\nfrom the root of the tree, using O(1)time at each node to determine how to con-\\ntinue the search. Similar paths are traced when looking for a replacement during adeletion, or when computing a position’s inorder predecessor or successor. We note\\nthat although a single call to the after method has worst-case running time of O(h),\\nthe nsuccessive calls made during a call to\\niter\\n require a total of O(n)time,\\nsince each edge is traced at most twice; in a sense, those calls have O(1)amortized\\ntime bounds. A similar argument can be used to prove the O(s+h)worst-case\\nbound for a call to ﬁnd\\nrange that reports sresults (see Exercise C-11.34).'),\n",

Balanced Search Trees 475\\n11.2 Balanced Search Trees\\nIn the closing of the previous section, we noted that if we could assume a random\\nseries of insertions and removals, the standard binary search tree supports O(logn)\\nexpected running times for the basic map operations. However, we may only claimO(n)worst-case time, because some sequences of operations may lead to an unbal-\\nanced tree with height proportional to n.\\nIn the remainder of this chapter, we explore four search tree algorithms that\\nprovide stronger performance guarantees. Three of the four data structures (A VLtrees, splay trees, and red-black trees) are based on augmenting a standard binary\\nsearch tree with occasional operations to reshape the tree and reduce its height.\\nThe primary operation to rebalance a binary search tree is known as a rotation .\\nDuring a rotation, we “rotate” a child to be above its parent, as diagrammed in\\nFigure 11.8.\\nyx\\ny\\nT1\\nT2 T3 T1 T2T3x\\nFigure 11.8: A rotation operation in a binary search tree. A rotation can be per-\\nformed to transform the left formation into the right, or the right formation into theleft. Note that all keys in subtree T\\n1have keys less than that of position x,a l lk e y s\\nin subtree T2have keys that are between those of positions xand y,a n da l lk e y si n\\nsubtree T3have keys that are greater than that of position y.\\nTo maintain the binary search tree property through a rotation, we note that\\nif position xwas a left child of position yprior to a rotation (and therefore the\\nkey of xis less than the key of y), then ybecomes the right child of xafter the\\nrotation, and vice versa. Furthermore, we must relink the subtree of items withkeys that lie between the keys of the two positions that are being rotated. Forexample, in Figure 11.8 the subtree labeled T\\n2represents items with keys that are\\nknown to be greater than that of position xand less than that of position y.I n t h e\\nﬁrst conﬁguration of that ﬁgure, T2is the right subtree of position x; in the second\\nconﬁguration, it is the left subtree of position y.\\nBecause a single rotation modiﬁes a constant number of parent-child relation-\\nships, it can be implemented in O(1)time with a linked binary tree representation.'),\n",

Search Trees\\nIn the context of a tree-balancing algorithm, a rotation allows the shape of a\\ntree to be modiﬁed while maintaining the search tree property. If used wisely, this\\noperation can be performed to avoid highly unbalanced tree conﬁgurations. Forexample, a rightward rotation from the ﬁrst formation of Figure 11.8 to the secondreduces the depth of each node in subtree T\\n1by one, while increasing the depth\\nof each node in subtree T3by one. (Note that the depth of nodes in subtree T2are\\nunaffected by the rotation.)\\nOne or more rotations can be combined to provide broader rebalancing within a\\ntree. One such compound operation we consider is a trinode restructuring . For this\\nmanipulation, we consider a position x, its parent y, and its grandparent z. The goal\\nis to restructure the subtree rooted at zin order to reduce the overall path length\\ntoxand its subtrees. Pseudo-code for a restructure (x)method is given in Code\\nFragment 11.9 and illustrated in Figure 11.9. In describing a trinode restructuring,we temporarily rename the positions x,y,a n d zasa,b,a n d c,s ot h a t aprecedes b\\nand bprecedes cin an inorder traversal of T. There are four possible orientations\\nmapping x,y,a n d ztoa,b,a n d c, as shown in Figure 11.9, which are uniﬁed\\ninto one case by our relabeling. The trinode restructuring replaces zwith the node\\nidentiﬁed as b, makes the children of this node be aand c, and makes the children\\nofaand cbe the four previous children of x,y,a n d z(other than xand y), while\\nmaintaining the inorder relationships of all the nodes in T.\\nAlgorithm restructure(x) :\\nInput: A position xof a binary search tree Tthat has both a parent yand a\\ngrandparent z\\nOutput: Tr\\nee Tafter a trinode restructuring (which corresponds to a single or\\ndouble rotation) involving positions x,y,a n dz\\n1:Let (a,b,c) be a left-to-right (inorder) listing of the positions x,y,a n dz,a n d\\nlet (T1,T2,T3,T4)be a left-to-right (inorder) listing of the four subtrees of x,\\ny,a n dznot rooted at x,y,o rz.\\n2:Replace the subtree rooted at zwith a new subtree rooted at b.\\n3:Letabe the left child of band let T1andT2be the left and right subtrees of a,\\nrespectively.\\n4:Letcbe the right child of band let T3andT4be the left and right subtrees of\\nc, respectively.\\nCode Fragment 11.9: The trinode restructuring operation in a binary search tree.\\nIn practice, the modiﬁcation of a tree Tcaused by a trinode restructuring op-\\neration can be implemented through case analysis either as a single rotation (as inFigure 11.9a and b) or as a double rotation (as in Figure 11.9c and d).

Search Trees\\n11.2.1 Python Framework for Balancing Search Trees\\nOurTreeMap class, introduced in Section 11.1.4, is a concrete map implementation\\nthat does not perform any explicit balancing operations. However, we designed\\nthat class to also serve as a base class for other subclasses that implement more\\nadvanced tree-balancing algorithms. A summary of our inheritance hierarchy is\\nshown in Figure 11.10.\\n(Section 11.3.2)MapBase\\n(Section 8.3.1)\\n(Section 11.4.3)TreeMap\\nSplayTreeMap(Section 11.1.4)\\n(Section 11.6.2)RedBlackTreeMap(Section 10.1.4)LinkedBinaryTree\\nAVLTreeMap\\nFigure 11.10: Our hierarchy of balanced search trees (with references to where they\\nare deﬁned). Recall that TreeMap inherits multiply from LinkedBinaryTree and\\nMapBase .\\nHooks for Rebalancing Operations\\nOur implementation of the basic map operations in Section 11.1.4 includes strategiccalls to three nonpublic methods that serve as hooks for rebalancing algorithms:\\n•A call to\\nrebalance\\n insert(p) is made from within the\\n setitem\\n method\\nimmediately after a new node is added to the tree at position p.\\n•A call to\\n rebalance\\n delete(p) is made each time a node has been deleted\\nfrom the tree, with position pidentifying the parent of the node that has just\\nbeen removed. Formally, this hook is called from within the public delete(p)\\nmethod, which is indirectly invoked by the public\\n delitem\\n (k)behavior.\\n•We also provide a hook,\\n rebalance\\n access(p) , that is called when an item at\\nposition pof a tree is accessed through a public method such as\\n getitem\\n .\\nThis hook is used by the splay tree structure (see Section 11.4) to restructure\\na tree so that more frequently accessed items are brought closer to the root.\\nWe provide trivial declarations of these three methods, in Code Fragment 11.10,\\nhaving bodies that do nothing (using the pass statement). A subclass of TreeMap\\nmay override any of these methods to implement a nontrivial action to rebalancea tree. This is another example of the template method design pattern , as seen in\\nSection 8.4.6.'),\n",

To simplify the\\ncode, we deﬁne an additional\\nrelink utility that properly links parent and child\\nnodes to each other, including the special case in which a “child” is a None ref-\\nerence. The focus of the\\n rotate method then becomes redeﬁning the relationship\\nbetween the parent and child, relinking a rotated node directly to its original grand-\\nparent, and shifting the “middle” subtree (that labeled as T2in Figure 11.8) between\\nthe rotated nodes. For the trinode restructuring, we determine whether to perform\\na single or double rotation, as originally described in Figure 11.9.\\nFactory for Creating Tree Nodes\\nWe draw attention to an important subtlety in the design of both our TreeMap class\\nand the original LinkedBinaryTree subclass. The low-level deﬁnition of a node is\\nprovided by the nested\\n Node class within LinkedBinaryTree . Yet, several of our\\ntree-balancing strategies require that auxiliary information be stored at each nodeto guide the balancing process. Those classes will override the nested\\nNode class\\nto provide storage for an additional ﬁeld.\\nWhenever we add a new node to the tree, as within the\\n add\\nright method of\\ntheLinkedBinaryTree (originally given in Code Fragment 8.10), we intentionally\\ninstantiate the node using the syntax self.\\nNode , rather than the qualiﬁed name\\nLinkedBinaryTree.\\n Node . This is vital to our framework! When the expression\\nself.\\nNode is applied to an instance of a tree (sub)class, Python’s name resolution\\nfollows the inheritance structure (as described in Section 2.5.2). If a subclass hasoverridden the deﬁnition for the\\nNode class, instantiation of self.\\nNode relies on\\nthe newly deﬁned node class.

Search Trees\\nAn immediate consequence of the height-balance property is that a subtree of an\\nA VL tree is itself an A VL tree. The height-balance property has also the important\\nconsequence of keeping the height small, as shown in the following proposition.\\nProposition 11.2: The height of an A VL tree storing nentries is O(logn).\\nJustiﬁcation: Instead of trying to ﬁnd an upper bound on the height of an A VL\\ntree directly, it turns out to be easier to work on the “inverse problem” of ﬁnding a\\nlower bound on the minimum number of nodes n(h)of an A VL tree with height h.\\nWe will show that n(h)grows at least exponentially. From this, it will be an easy\\nstep to derive that the height of an A VL tree storing nentries is O(logn).\\nWe begin by noting that n(1)=1a n d n(2)=2, because an A VL tree of height\\n1 must have exactly one node and an A VL tree of height 2 must have at least twonodes. Now, an A VL tree with the minimum number of nodes having height hfor\\nh≥3, is such that both its subtrees are A VL trees with the minimum number of\\nnodes: one with height h−1 and the other with height h−2. Taking the root into\\naccount, we obtain the following formula that relates n(h)ton(h−1)and n(h−2),\\nforh≥3:\\nn(h)=1+n(h−1)+ n(h−2). (11.1)\\nAt this point, the reader familiar with the properties of Fibonacci progressions (Sec-\\ntion 1.8 and Exercise C-3.49) will already see that n(h)is a function exponential\\ninh.\\nTo formalize that observation, we proceed as follows.\\nFormula 11.1 implies that n(h)is a strictly increasing function of h. Thus, we\\nknow that n(h−1)>n(h−2). Replacing n(h−1)with n(h−2)in Formula 11.1\\nand dropping the 1, we get, for h≥3,\\nn(h)>2·n(h−2). (11.2)\\nFormula 11.2 indicates that n(h)at least doubles each time hincreases by 2, which\\nintuitively means that n(h)grows exponentially. To show this fact in a formal way,\\nwe apply Formula 11.2 repeatedly, yielding the following series of inequalities:\\nn(h)>2·n(h−2)\\n>4·n(h−4)\\n>8·n(h−6)\\n...\\n>2i·n(h−2i). (11.3)\\nThat is, n(h)>2i·n(h−2i), for any integer i, such that h−2i≥1.

Thus, the height-balance property characterizing\\nA VL trees is equivalent to saying that every position is balanced.\\nThe insertion and deletion operations for A VL trees begin similarly to the corre-\\nsponding operations for (standard) binary search trees, but with post-processing foreach operation to restore the balance of any portions of the tree that are adverselyaffected by the change.\\nInsertion\\nSuppose that tree Tsatisﬁes the height-balance property, and hence is an A VL tree,\\nprior to the insertion of a new item. An insertion of a new item in a binary searchtree, as described in Section 11.1.3, results in a new node at a leaf position p.T h i s\\naction may violate the height-balance property (see, for example, Figure 11.12a),yet the only positions that may become unbalanced are ancestors of p, because\\nthose are the only positions whose subtrees have changed.

We show the heights of nodes above them, and we identify the nodes x,\\ny,a n d zand subtrees T\\n1,T2,T3,a n d T4participating in the trinode restructuring.\\nWe restore the balance of the nodes in the binary search tree Tby a simple\\n“search-and-repair” strategy. In particular, let zbe the ﬁrst position we encounter in\\ngoing up from ptoward the root of Tsuch that zis unbalanced (see Figure 11.12a.)\\nAlso, let ydenote the child of zwith higher height (and note that ymust be an\\nancestor of p). Finally, let xbe the child of ywith higher height (there cannot be a\\ntie and position xmust also be an ancestor of p, possibly pitself). We rebalance\\nthe subtree rooted at zby calling the trinode restructuring method, restructure (x),\\noriginally described in Section 11.2. An example of such a restructuring in thecontext of an A VL insertion is portrayed in Figure 11.12.\\nTo formally argue the correctness of this process in reestablishing the A VL\\nheight-balance property, we consider the implication of zbeing the nearest ancestor\\nofpthat became unbalanced after the insertion of p. It must be that the height\\nofyincreased by one due to the insertion and that it is now 2 greater than its\\nsibling. Since yremains balanced, it must be that it formerly had subtrees with\\nequal heights, and that the subtree containing xhas increased its height by one.\\nThat subtree increased either because x=p, and thus its height changed from 0\\nto 1, or because xpreviously had equal-height subtrees and the height of the one\\ncontaining phas increased by 1. Letting h≥0 denote the height of the tallest child\\nofx, this scenario might be portrayed as in Figure 11.13.\\nAfter the trinode restructuring, we see that each of x,y,a n d zhas become\\nbalanced. Furthermore, the node that becomes the root of the subtree after therestructuring has height h+2, which is precisely the height that zhad before the\\ninsertion of the new item. Therefore, any ancestor of zthat became temporarily\\nunbalanced becomes balanced again, and this one restructuring restores the height-\\nbalance property globally .'),\n",

In particular, if position prepresents\\nthe parent of the removed node in tree T, there may be an unbalanced node on the\\npath from pto the root of T. (See Figure 11.14a.)

Also, let ybe the child of zwith larger height (note that\\nposition yis the child of zthat is not an ancestor of p), and let xbe the child of y\\ndeﬁned as follows: If one of the children of yis taller than the other, let xbe the\\ntaller child of y; else (both children of yhave the same height), let xbe the child of\\nyon the same side as y(that is, if yis the left child of z,l e t xbe the left child of\\ny,e l s el e t xbe the right child of y). In any case, we then perform a restructure (x)\\noperation. (See Figure 11.14b.)\\nThe restructured subtree is rooted at the middle position denoted as bin the\\ndescription of the trinode restructuring operation. The height-balance property isguaranteed to be locally restored within the subtree of b. (See Exercises R-11.11\\nand R-11.12). Unfortunately, this trinode restructuring may reduce the height of the\\nsubtree rooted at bby 1, which may cause an ancestor of bto become unbalanced.\\nSo, after rebalancing z, we continue walking up Tlooking for unbalanced positions.\\nIf we ﬁnd another, we perform a restructure operation to restore its balance, and\\ncontinue marching up Tlooking for more, all the way to the root.

Search Trees\\n11.3.2 Python Implementation\\nA complete implementation of an AVLTreeMap class is provided in Code Frag-\\nments 11.12 and 11.13. It inherits from the standard TreeMap class and relies on\\nthe balancing framework described in Section 11.2.1. We highlight two important\\naspects of our implementation. First, the AVLTreeMap overrides the deﬁnition of\\nthe nested\\n Node class, as shown in Code Fragment 11.12, in order to provide sup-\\nport for storing the height of the subtree stored at a node. We also provide several\\nutilities involving heights of nodes, and the corresponding positions.\\nTo implement the core logic of the A VL balancing strategy, we deﬁne a utility,\\nnamed\\n rebalance , that sufﬁces as a hook for restoring the height-balance property\\nafter an insertion or a deletion. Although the inherited behaviors for insertion anddeletion are quite different, the necessary post-processing for an A VL tree can be\\nuniﬁed. In both cases, we trace an upward path from the position pat which the\\nchange took place, recalculating the height of each position based on the (updated)\\nheights of its children, and using a trinode restructuring operation if an imbalancedposition is reached. If we reach an ancestor with height that is unchanged by the\\noverall map operation, or if we perform a trinode restructuring that results in the\\nsubtree having the same height it had before the map operation, we stop the pro-cess; no further ancestor’s height will change.

This amortized performance matches the worst-case performance of A VL trees, (2,4)trees, and red-black trees, but it does so\\nusing a simple binary tree that does not need any extra balance information storedat each of its nodes. In addition, splay trees have a number of other interestingproperties that are not shared by these other balanced search trees.

That is, each internal node\\nis a d-node such that d≥2.\\n•Each internal d-node wofTwith children c1,..., cdstores an ordered set of\\nd−1 key-value pairs (k1,v1),...,(kd−1,vd−1),w h e r e k1≤···≤ kd−1.\\n•Let us conventionally deﬁne k0=−∞ and kd=+∞.

This simple viewpoint\\ngives rise to the rule that a d-node stores d−1 regular keys, and it also forms the\\nbasis of the algorithm for searching in a multiway search tree.\\nBy the above deﬁnition, the external nodes of a multiway search do not store\\nany data and serve only as “placeholders.” These external nodes can be efﬁcientlyrepresented by None references, as has been our convention with binary search\\ntrees (Section 11.1). However, for the sake of exposition, we will discuss these\\nas actual nodes that do not store anything. Based on this deﬁnition, there is an\\ninteresting relationship between the number of key-value pairs and the number ofexternal nodes in a multiway search tree.\\nProposition 11.7:\\nAn n-item multiway search tree has n+1external nodes.\\nWe leave the justiﬁcation of this proposition as an exercise (C-11.52).'),\n",

Search Trees\\nSearching in a Multiway Tree\\nSearching for an item with key kin a multiway search tree Tis simple. We perform\\nsuch a search by tracing a path in Tstarting at the root. (See Figure 11.23b and c.)\\nWhen we are at a d-node wduring this search, we compare the key kwith the keys\\nk1,..., kd−1stored at w.I f k=kifor some i, the search is successfully completed.\\nOtherwise, we continue the search in the child ciofwsuch that ki−1<k<ki.\\n(Recall that we conventionally deﬁne k0=−∞ and kd=+∞.) If we reach an\\nexternal node, then we know that there is no item with key kinT, and the search\\nterminates unsuccessfully.\\nData Structures for Representing Multiway Search Trees\\nIn Section 8.3.3, we discuss a linked data structure for representing a general tree.\\nThis representation can also be used for a multiway search tree. When using ageneral tree to implement a multiway search tree, we must store at each node one\\nor more key-value pairs associated with that node. That is, we need to store with w\\na reference to some collection that stores the items for w.\\nDuring a search for key kin a multiway search tree, the primary operation\\nneeded when navigating a node is ﬁnding the smallest key at that node that is greaterthan or equal to k. For this reason, it is natural to model the information at a\\nnode itself as a sorted map, allowing use of the ﬁnd\\nge(k) method. We say such\\na map serves as a secondary data structure to support the primary data structure\\nrepresented by the entire multiway search tree. This reasoning may at ﬁrst seemlike a circular argument, since we need a representation of a (secondary) ordered\\nmap to represent a (primary) ordered map. We can avoid any circular dependence,however, by using the bootstrapping technique, where we use a simple solution to\\na problem to create a new, more advanced solution.\\nIn the context of a multiway search tree, a natural choice for the secondary\\nstructure at each node is the SortedTableMap of Section 10.3.1. Because we want\\nto determine the associated value in case of a match for key k, and otherwise the\\ncorresponding child c\\nisuch that ki−1<k<ki, we recommend having each key\\nkiin the secondary structure map to the pair (vi,ci). With such a realization of a\\nmultiway search tree T, processing a d-node wwhile searching for an item of T\\nwith key kcan be performed using a binary search operation in O(logd)time. Let\\ndmaxdenote the maximum number of children of any node of T,a n dl e t hdenote the\\nheight of T. The search time in a multiway search tree is therefore O(hlogdmax ).\\nIfdmaxis a constant, the running time for performing a search is O(h).\\nThe primary efﬁciency goal for a multiway search tree is to keep the height as\\nsmall as possible. We next discuss a strategy that caps dmaxat 4 while guaranteeing\\na height hthat is logarithmic in n, the total number of items stored in the map.'),\n",

It also gives rise to the alternative name “2-3-4 tree,” since itimplies that each internal node in the tree has 2, 3, or 4 children. Another implica-tion of this rule is that we can represent the secondary map stored at each internalnode using an unordered list or an ordered array, and still achieve O(1)-time perfor-\\nmance for all operations (since d\\nmax =4).

Therefore, we obtain\\n2h≤n+1≤4h.\\nTaking the logarithm in base 2 of the terms for the above inequalities, we get that\\nh≤log (n+1)≤2h,\\nwhich justiﬁes our claim (Formula 11.9) when terms are rearranged.\\nProposition 11.8 states that the size and depth properties are sufﬁcient for keep-\\ning a multiway tree balanced. Moreover, this proposition implies that performing\\na search in a (2,4)tree takes O(logn)time and that the speciﬁc realization of the\\nsecondary structures at the nodes is not a crucial design choice, since the maximumnumber of children d\\nmaxis a constant.\\nMaintaining the size and depth properties requires some effort after performing\\ninsertions and deletions in a (2,4)tree, however. We discuss these operations next.\\nInsertion\\nTo insert a new item (k,v), with key k,i n t oa (2,4)tree T, we ﬁrst perform a search\\nfork. Assuming that Thas no item with key k, this search terminates unsuccessfully\\nat an external node z.L e t wbe the parent of z. We insert the new item into node w\\nand add a new child y(an external node) to won the left of z.\\nOur insertion method preserves the depth property, since we add a new external\\nnode at the same level as existing external nodes. Nevertheless, it may violate thesize property. Indeed, if a node wwas previously a 4-node, then it would become\\na 5-node after the insertion, which causes the tree Tto no longer be a (2,4)tree.\\nThis type of violation of the size property is called an overﬂow at node w,a n di t\\nmust be resolved in order to restore the properties of a (2,4)tree. Let c\\n1,..., c5be\\nthe children of w,a n dl e t k1,..., k4be the keys stored at w. To remedy the overﬂow\\nat node w, we perform a split operation on was follows (see Figure 11.25):\\n•Replace wwith two nodes w′and w′′,w h e r e\\n◦w′is a 3-node with children c1,c2,c3storing keys k1and k2\\n◦w′′is a 2-node with children c4,c5storing key k4.\\n•Ifwis the root of T, create a new root node u; else, let ube the parent of w.\\n•Insert key k3into uand make w′and w′′children of u,s ot h a ti f wwas child\\niofu,t h e nw′and w′′become children iand i+1o f u, respectively.\\nAs a consequence of a split operation on node w, a new overﬂow may occur at the\\nparent uofw. If such an overﬂow occurs, it triggers in turn a split at node u.( S e e\\nFigure 11.26.) A split operation either eliminates the overﬂow or propagates it intothe parent of the current node. We show a sequence of insertions in a (2,4)tree in\\nFigure 11.27.'),\n",

Suppose, for\\ninstance, that the item with key kthat we wish to remove is stored in the ithitem\\n(ki,vi)at a node zthat has only internal-node children. In this case, we swap the\\nitem (ki,vi)with an appropriate item that is stored at a node wwith external-node\\nchildren as follows (see Figure 11.28d):\\n1. We ﬁnd the rightmost internal node win the subtree rooted at the ithchild of\\nz, noting that the children of node ware all external nodes.\\n2. We swap the item (ki,vi)atzwith the last item of w.\\nOnce we ensure that the item to remove is stored at a node wwith only external-\\nnode children (because either it was already at wor we swapped it into w), we\\nsimply remove the item from wand remove the ithexternal node of w.\\nRemoving an item (and a child) from a node was described above preserves the\\ndepth property, for we always remove an external child from a node wwith only\\nexternal children. However, in removing such an external node, we may violate\\nthe size property at w. Indeed, if wwas previously a 2-node, then it becomes a\\n1-node with no items after the removal (Figure 11.28a and d), which is not allowed\\nin a (2,4)tree.

Search Trees\\n11.6 Red-Black Trees\\nAlthough A VL trees and (2,4)trees have a number of nice properties, they also\\nhave some disadvantages. For instance, A VL trees may require many restructure\\noperations (rotations) to be performed after a deletion, and (2,4)trees may require\\nmany split or fusing operations to be performed after an insertion or removal. Thedata structure we discuss in this section, the red-black tree, does not have thesedrawbacks; it uses O(1)structural changes after an update in order to stay balanced.\\nFormally, a red-black tree is a binary search tree (see Section 11.1) with nodes\\ncolored red and black in a way that satisﬁes the following properties:\\nRoot Property :The root is black.\\nRed Property :The children of a red node (if any) are black.\\nDepth Property :All nodes with zero or one children have the same black depth ,\\ndeﬁned as the number of black ancestors. (Recall that a node is its own\\nancestor).\\nAn example of a red-black tree is shown in Figure 11.30.\\n10 13 171512\\n5\\n3\\n4\\n8 671 1 14\\nFigure 11.30: An example of a red-black tree, with “red” nodes drawn in white. The\\ncommon black depth for this tree is 3.\\nWe can make the red-black tree deﬁnition more intuitive by noting an interest-\\ning correspondence between red-black trees and (2,4)trees (excluding their trivial\\nexternal nodes). Namely, given a red-black tree, we can construct a corresponding(2,4)tree by merging every red node winto its parent, storing the entry from wat\\nits parent, and with the children of wbecoming ordered children of the parent. For\\nexample, the red-black tree in Figure 11.30 corresponds to the (2,4)tree from Fig-\\nure 11.24, as illustrated in Figure 11.31. The depth property of the red-black treecorresponds to the depth property of the (2,4)tree since exactly one black node of\\nthe red-black tree contributes to each node of the corresponding (2,4)tree.\\nConversely, we can transform any (2,4)tree into a corresponding red-black tree\\nby coloring each node wblack and then performing the following transformations,\\nas illustrated in Figure 11.32.'),\n",

Because of the correspondence between red-black trees and (2,4)\\ntrees, we know that h′=d. Hence, by Proposition 11.8, d=h′≤log (n+1)−1. By\\nthe red property, h≤2d. Thus, we obtain h≤2log (n+1)−2. The other inequality,\\nlog (n+1)−1≤h, follows from Proposition 8.8 and the fact that Thas nnodes.\\n11.6.1 Red-Black Tree Operations\\nThe algorithm for searching in a red-black tree Tis the same as that for a standard\\nbinary search tree (Section 11.1). Thus, searching in a red-black tree takes time\\nproportional to the height of the tree, which is O(logn)by Proposition 11.9.\\nThe correspondence between (2,4)trees and red-black trees provides important\\nintuition that we will use in our discussion of how to perform updates in red-black\\ntrees; in fact, the update algorithms for red-black trees can seem mysteriously com-\\nplex without this intuition. Split and fuse operations of a (2,4)tree will be effec-\\ntively mimicked by recoloring neighboring red-black tree nodes. A rotation withina red-black tree will be used to change orientations of a 3-node between the two\\nforms shown in Figure 11.32(b).\\nInsertion\\nNow consider the insertion of a key-value pair (k,v)into a red-black tree T.T h e\\nalgorithm initially proceeds as in a standard binary search tree (Section 11.1.3).\\nNamely, we search for kinTuntil we reach a null subtree, and we introduce a new\\nleaf xat that position, storing the item. In the special case that xis the only node\\nofT, and thus the root, we color it black. In all other cases, we color xred. This\\naction corresponds to inserting (k,v)into a node of the (2,4)tree T′with external\\nchildren. The insertion preserves the root and depth properties of T,b u ti tm a y\\nviolate the red property. Indeed, if xis not the root of Tand the parent yofxis\\nred, then we have a parent and a child (namely, yand x) that are both red. Note that\\nby the root property, ycannot be the root of T, and by the red property (which was\\npreviously satisﬁed), the parent zofymust be black. Since xand its parent are red,\\nbut x’s grandparent zis black, we call this violation of the red property a double\\nredat node x. To remedy a double red, we consider two cases.'),\n",

Red-Black Trees 515\\nCase 1: The Sibling s of y Is Black (or None) .(See Figure 11.33.) In this case,\\nthe double red denotes the fact that we have added the new node to a cor-\\nresponding 3-node of the (2,4)tree T′, effectively creating a malformed\\n4-node. This formation has one red node ( y) that is the parent of another\\nred node ( x), while we want it to have the two red nodes as siblings instead.\\nTo ﬁx this problem, we perform a trinode restructuring ofT. The trinode\\nrestructuring is done by the operation restructure (x), which consists of the\\nfollowing steps (see again Figure 11.33; this operation is also discussed inSection 11.2):\\n•Take node x, its parent y, and grandparent z, and temporarily relabel\\nthem as a,b,a n d c, in left-to-right order, so that a,b,a n d cwill be\\nvisited in this order by an inorder tree traversal.\\n•Replace the grandparent zwith the node labeled b, and make nodes a\\nand cthe children of b, keeping inorder relationships unchanged.\\nAfter performing the restructure (x)operation, we color bblack and we color\\naand cred. Thus, the restructuring eliminates the double-red problem. No-\\ntice that the portion of any path through the restructured part of the tree is\\nincident to exactly one black node, both before and after the trinode restruc-\\nturing.

To ﬁx the problem,\\nwe perform the equivalent of a split operation. Namely, we do a recoloring :\\nwe color yand sblack and their parent zred (unless zis the root, in which\\ncase, it remains black). Notice that unless zis the root, the portion of any\\npath through the affected part of the tree is incident to exactly one black\\nnode, both before and after the recoloring. Therefore, the black depth of the\\ntree is unaffected by the recoloring unless zis the root, in which case it is\\nincreased by one.\\nHowever, it is possible that the double-red problem reappears after such a\\nrecoloring, albeit higher up in the tree T,s i n c ez may have a red parent. If\\nthe double-red problem reappears at z, then we repeat the consideration of the\\ntwo cases at z. Thus, a recoloring either eliminates the double-red problem\\nat node x, or propagates it to the grandparent zofx. We continue going\\nupTperforming recolorings until we ﬁnally resolve the double-red problem\\n(with either a ﬁnal recoloring or a trinode restructuring).

Red-Black Trees 519\\nDeletion\\nDeleting an item with key kfrom a red-black tree Tinitially proceeds as for a binary\\nsearch tree (Section 11.1.3). Structurally, the process results in the removal a node\\nthat has at most one child (either that originally containing key kor its inorder\\npredecessor) and the promotion of its remaining child (if any).\\nIf the removed node was red, this structural change does not affect the black\\ndepths of any paths in the tree, nor introduce any red violations, and so the resultingtree remains a valid red-black tree. In the corresponding (2,4)tree T\\n′, this case\\ndenotes the shrinking of a 3-node or 4-node. If the removed node was black, thenit either had zero children or it had one child that was a red leaf (because the nullsubtree of the removed node has black height 0). In the latter case, the removednode represents the black part of a corresponding 3-node, and we restore the red-black properties by recoloring the promoted child to black.\\nThe more complex case is when a (nonroot) black leaf is removed. In the cor-\\nresponding (2,4)tree, this denotes the removal of an item from a 2-node. Without\\nrebalancing, such a change results in a deﬁcit of one for the black depth along thepath leading to the deleted item. By necessity, the removed node must have a sib-ling whose subtree has black height 1 (given that this was a valid red-black treeprior to the deletion of the black leaf).\\nTo remedy this scenario, we consider a more general setting with a node zthat\\nis known to have two subtrees, T\\nheavy and Tlight, such that the root of Tlight(if any) is\\nblack and such that the black depth of Theavy is exactly one more than that of Tlight,\\nas portrayed in Figure 11.37. In the case of a removed black leaf, zis the parent of\\nthat leaf and Tlightis trivially the empty subtree that remains after the deletion. We\\ndescribe the more general case of a deﬁcit because our algorithm for rebalancingthe tree will, in some cases, push the deﬁcit higher in the tree (just as the resolution\\nof a deletion in a (2,4)tree sometimes cascades upward).

The fact that yhas a red child\\nassures us that it represents either a 3-node or a 4-node.

Search Trees\\nPerformance of Red-Black Trees\\nThe asymptotic performance of a red-black tree is identical to that of an A VL tree\\nor a (2,4)tree in terms of the sorted map ADT, with guaranteed logarithmic time\\nbounds for most operations. (See Table 11.2 for a summary of the A VL perfor-mance.) The primary advantage of a red-black tree is that an insertion or deletionrequires only a constant number of restructuring operations . (This is in contrast\\nto A VL trees and (2,4)trees, both of which require a logarithmic number of struc-\\ntural changes per map operation in the worst case.) That is, an insertion or deletion\\nin a red-black tree requires logarithmic time for a search, and may require a loga-\\nrithmic number of recoloring operations that cascade upward. Yet we show, in thefollowing propositions, that there are a constant number of rotations or restructureoperations for a single map operation.\\nProposition 11.10:\\nThe insertion of an item in a red-black tree storing nitems\\ncan be done in O(logn)time and requires O(logn)recolorings and at most one\\ntrinode restructuring.\\nJustiﬁcation: Recall that an insertion begins with a downward search, the cre-\\nation of a new leaf node, and then a potential upward effort to remedy a double-red\\nviolation. There may be logarithmically many recoloring operations due to an up-ward cascading of Case 2 applications, but a single application of the Case 1 actioneliminates the double-red problem with a trinode restructuring. Therefore, at most\\none restructuring operation is needed for a red-black tree insertion.\\nProposition 11.11: The algorithm for deleting an item from a red-black tree with\\nnitems takes O(logn)time and performs O(logn)recolorings and at most two\\nrestructuring operations.\\nJustiﬁcation: A deletion begins with the standard binary search tree deletion\\nalgorithm, which requires time proportional to the height of the tree; for red-black\\ntrees, that height is O(logn). The subsequent rebalancing takes place along an\\nupward path from the parent of a deleted node.\\nWe considered three cases to remedy a resulting black deﬁcit. Case 1 requires a\\ntrinode restructuring operation, yet completes the process, so this case is applied at\\nmost once. Case 2 may be applied logarithmically many times, but it only involves\\na recoloring of up to two nodes per application. Case 3 requires a rotation, but thiscase can only apply once, because if the rotation does not resolve the problem, thevery next action will be a terminal application of either Case 1 or Case 2.\\nIn the worst case, there will be O(logn)recolorings from Case 2, a single rota-\\ntion from Case 3, and a trinode restructuring from Case 1.\\n'),\n",

Red-Black Trees 525\\n11.6.2 Python Implementation\\nA complete implementation of a RedBlackTreeMap class is provided in Code Frag-\\nments 11.15 through 11.17. It inherits from the standard TreeMap class and relies\\non the balancing framework described in Section 11.2.1.\\nWe begin, in Code Fragment 11.15, by overriding the deﬁnition of the nested\\nNode class to introduce an additional Boolean ﬁeld to denote the current color\\nof a node. Our constructor intentionally sets the color of a new node to red to\\nbe consistent with our approach for inserting items. We deﬁne several additional\\nutility functions, at the top of Code Fragment 11.16, that aid in setting the color of\\nnodes and querying various conditions.\\nWhen an element has been inserted as a leaf in the tree, the\\n rebalance\\n insert\\nhook is called, allowing us the opportunity to modify the tree. The new node isred by default, so we need only look for the special case of the new node being\\nthe root (in which case it should be colored black), or the possibility that we have\\na double-red violation because the new node’s parent is also red. To remedy suchviolations, we closely follow the case analysis described in Section 11.6.1.\\nThe rebalancing after a deletion also follows the case analysis described in\\nSection 11.6.1. An additional challenge is that by the time the\\nrebalance\\n hook is\\ncalled, the old node has already been removed from the tree. That hook is invokedon the parent of the removed node. Some of the case analysis depends on knowing\\nabout the properties of the removed node. Fortunately, we can reverse engineer thatinformation by relying on the red-black tree properties. In particular, if pdenotes\\nthe parent of the removed node, it must be that:\\n•Ifphas no children, the removed node was a red leaf. (Exercise R-11.26.)\\n•Ifphas one child, the removed node was a black leaf, causing a deﬁcit,\\nunless that one remaining child is a red leaf. (Exercise R-11.27.)\\n•Ifphas two children, the removed node was a black node with one red child,\\nwhich was promoted.

Why Study Sorting Algorithms? 537\\n12.1 Why Study Sorting Algorithms?\\nMuch of this chapter focuses on algorithms for sorting a collection of objects.\\nGiven a collection, the goal is to rearrange the elements so that they are orderedfrom smallest to largest (or to produce a new copy of the sequence with such anorder). As we did when studying priority queues (see Section 9.4), we assume that\\nsuch a consistent order exists. In Python, the natural order of objects is typically\\n1\\ndeﬁned using the <operator having following properties:\\n•Irreﬂexive property :k̸<k.\\n•Transitive property :i f k1<k2and k2<k3,t h e n k1<k3.\\nThe transitive property is important as it allows us to infer the outcome of certain\\ncomparisons without taking the time to perform those comparisons, thereby leadingto more efﬁcient algorithms.\\nSorting is among the most important, and well studied, of computing problems.\\nData sets are often stored in sorted order, for example, to allow for efﬁcient searcheswith the binary search algorithm (see Section 4.1.3). Many advanced algorithmsfor a variety of problems rely on sorting as a subroutine.\\nPython has built-in support for sorting data, in the form of the sortmethod of\\nthelistclass that rearranges the contents of a list, and the built-in sorted function\\nthat produces a new list containing the elements of an arbitrary collection in sortedorder. Those built-in functions use advanced algorithms (some of which we willdescribe in this chapter), and they are highly optimized. A programmer shouldtypically rely on calls to the built-in sorting functions, as it is rare to have a specialenough circumstance to warrant implementing a sorting algorithm from scratch.\\nWith that said, it remains important to have a deep understanding of sorting\\nalgorithms. Most immediately, when calling the built-in function, it is good toknow what to expect in terms of efﬁciency and how that may depend upon theinitial order of elements or the type of objects that are being sorted. More generally,the ideas and approaches that have led to advances in the development of sorting\\nalgorithm carry over to algorithm development in many other areas of computing.\\nWe have introduced several sorting algorithms already in this book:\\n•Insertion-sort (see Sections 5.5.2, 7.5, and 9.4.1)\\n•Selection-sort (see Section 9.4.1)\\n•Bubble-sort (see Exercise C-7.38)\\n•Heap-sort (see Section 9.4.2)\\nIn this chapter, we present four other sorting algorithms, called merge-sort ,\\nquick-sort ,bucket-sort ,a n d radix-sort , and then discuss the advantages and disad-\\nvantages of the various algorithms in Section 12.5.\\n1In Section 12.6.1, we will explore another technique used in Python for sorting data according\\nto an order other than the natural order deﬁned by the <operator.'),\n",

Sorting and Selection\\n12.2 Merge-Sort\\n12.2.1 Divide-and-Conquer\\nThe ﬁrst two algorithms we describe in this chapter, merge-sort and quick-sort, use\\nrecursion in an algorithmic design pattern called divide-and-conquer .W e h a v e\\nalready seen the power of recursion in describing algorithms in an elegant manner(see Chapter 4). The divide-and-conquer pattern consists of the following three\\nsteps:\\n1.Divide: If the input size is smaller than a certain threshold (say, one or two\\nelements), solve the problem directly using a straightforward method and\\nreturn the solution so obtained. Otherwise, divide the input data into two ormore disjoint subsets.\\n2.Conquer: Recursively solve the subproblems associated with the subsets.\\n3.Combine: Take the solutions to the subproblems and merge them into a so-\\nlution to the original problem.\\nUsing Divide-and-Conquer for Sorting\\nWe will ﬁrst describe the merge-sort algorithm at a high level, without focusing onwhether the data is an array-based (Python) list or a linked list; we will soon give\\nconcrete implementations for each. To sort a sequence Swith nelements using the\\nthree divide-and-conquer steps, the merge-sort algorithm proceeds as follows:\\n1.Divide: IfShas zero or one element, return Simmediately; it is already\\nsorted. Otherwise ( Shas at least two elements), remove all the elements\\nfrom Sand put them into two sequences, S\\n1and S2, each containing about\\nhalf of the elements of S;t h a ti s , S1contains the ﬁrst ⌊n/2⌋elements of S,\\nand S2contains the remaining ⌈n/2⌉elements.\\n2.Conquer: Recursively sort sequences S1and S2.\\n3.Combine: Put back the elements into Sby merging the sorted sequences S1\\nand S2into a sorted sequence.\\nIn reference to the divide step, we recall that the notation ⌊x⌋indicates the ﬂoor of\\nx, that is, the largest integer k, such that k≤x. Similarly, the notation ⌈x⌉indicates\\ntheceiling ofx, that is, the smallest integer m, such that x≤m.'),\n",

Let n1and n2\\nbe the number of elements of S1and S2, respectively. It is clear that the operations\\nperformed inside each pass of the while loop take O(1)time. The key observation is\\nthat during each iteration of the loop, one element is copied from either S1orS2into\\nS(and that element is considered no further). Therefore, the number of iterations\\nof the loop is n1+n2. Thus, the running time of algorithm merge isO(n1+n2).\\nHaving analyzed the running time of the merge algorithm used to combine\\nsubproblems, let us analyze the running time of the entire merge-sort algorithm,\\nassuming it is given an input sequence of nelements. For simplicity, we restrict our\\nattention to the case where nis a power of 2. We leave it to an exercise (R-12.3) to\\nshow that the result of our analysis also holds when nis not a power of 2.\\nWhen evaluating the merge-sort recursion, we rely on the analysis technique\\nintroduced in Section 4.2. We account for the amount of time spent within eachrecursive call, but excluding any time spent waiting for successive recursive callsto terminate.

Sorting and Selection\\n12.2.4 Merge-Sort and Recurrence Equations ⋆\\nThere is another way to justify that the running time of the merge-sort algorithm is\\nO(nlogn)(Proposition 12.2). Namely, we can deal more directly with the recursive\\nnature of the merge-sort algorithm. In this section, we present such an analysis of\\nthe running time of merge-sort, and in so doing, introduce the mathematical concept\\nof arecurrence equation (also known as recurrence relation ).\\nLet the function t(n)denote the worst-case running time of merge-sort on an\\ninput sequence of size n. Since merge-sort is recursive, we can characterize func-\\ntion t(n)by means of an equation where the function t(n)is recursively expressed\\nin terms of itself. In order to simplify our characterization of t(n), let us restrict\\nour attention to the case when nis a power of 2. (We leave the problem of showing\\nthat our asymptotic characterization still holds in the general case as an exercise.)In this case, we can specify the deﬁnition of t(n)as\\nt(n)={b ifn≤1\\n2t(n/2)+ cnotherwise.\\nAn expression such as the one above is called a recurrence equation, since thefunction appears on both the left- and right-hand sides of the equal sign. Althoughsuch a characterization is correct and accurate, what we really desire is a big-Oh\\ntype of characterization of t(n)that does not involve the function t(n)itself. That\\nis, we want a closed-form characterization of t(n).\\nWe can obtain a closed-form solution by applying the deﬁnition of a recurrence\\nequation, assuming nis relatively large. For example, after one more application\\nof the equation above, we can write a new recurrence for t(n)as\\nt(n)= 2(2t(n/2\\n2)+( cn/2)) + cn\\n=22t(n/22)+2(cn/2)+ cn =22t(n/22)+2cn.\\nIf we apply the equation again, we get t(n)=23t(n/23)+3cn. At this point, we\\nshould see a pattern emerging, so that after applying this equation itimes, we get\\nt(n)= 2it(n/2i)+ icn.\\nThe issue that remains, then, is to determine when to stop this process. To see whento stop, recall that we switch to the closed form t(n)= bwhen n≤1, which will\\noccur when 2\\ni=n. In other words, this will occur when i=logn.M a k i n g t h i s\\nsubstitution, then, yields\\nt(n)= 2lognt(n/2logn)+(logn)cn\\n= nt(1)+ cnlogn\\n= nb+cnlogn.\\nThat is, we get an alternative justiﬁcation of the fact that t(n)isO(nlogn).'),\n",

In particular, the quick-sort algorithmconsists of the following three steps (see Figure 12.8):\\n1.Divide: IfShas at least two elements (nothing needs to be done if Shas\\nzero or one element), select a speciﬁc element xfrom S, which is called the\\npivot . As is common practice, choose the pivot xto be the last element in S.\\nRemove all the elements from Sand put them into three sequences:\\n•L, storing the elements in Sless than x\\n•E, storing the elements in Sequal to x\\n•G, storing the elements in Sgreater than x\\nOf course, if the elements of Sare distinct, then Eholds just one element—\\nthe pivot itself.\\n2.Conquer: Recursively sort sequences Land G.\\n3.Combine: Put back the elements into Sin order by ﬁrst inserting the elements\\nofL, then those of E, and ﬁnally those of G.\\n2.

Quick-Sort 551\\nLike merge-sort, the execution of quick-sort can be visualized by means of a bi-\\nnary recursion tree, called the quick-sort tree . Figure 12.9 summarizes an execution\\nof the quick-sort algorithm by showing the input and output sequences processed at\\neach node of the quick-sort tree. The step-by-step evolution of the quick-sort treeis shown in Figures 12.10, 12.11, and 12.12.\\nUnlike merge-sort, however, the height of the quick-sort tree associated with an\\nexecution of quick-sort is linear in the worst case. This happens, for example, if thesequence consists of ndistinct elements and is already sorted. Indeed, in this case,\\nthe standard choice of the last element as pivot yields a subsequence Lof size n−1,\\nwhile subsequence Ehas size 1 and subsequence Ghas size 0. At each invocation\\nof quick-sort on subsequence L, the size decreases by 1.

Sorting and Selection\\nRunning Time of Quick-Sort\\nWe can analyze the running time of quick-sort with the same technique used for\\nmerge-sort in Section 12.2.3. Namely, we can identify the time spent at each nodeof the quick-sort tree Tand sum up the running times for all the nodes.\\nExamining Code Fragment 12.5, we see that the divide step and the ﬁnal con-\\ncatenation of quick-sort can be implemented in linear time. Thus, the time spentat a node vofTis proportional to the input size s(v)ofv, deﬁned as the size of\\nthe sequence handled by the invocation of quick-sort associated with node v.S i n c e\\nsubsequence Ehas at least one element (the pivot), the sum of the input sizes of the\\nchildren of vis at most s(v)−1.\\nLet s\\nidenote the sum of the input sizes of the nodes at depth ifor a particular\\nquick-sort tree T. Clearly, s0=n, since the root rofTis associated with the entire\\nsequence. Also, s1≤n−1, since the pivot is not propagated to the children of r.\\nMore generally, it must be that si<si−1since the elements of the subsequences at\\ndepth iall come from distinct subsequences at depth i−1, and at least one element\\nfrom depth i−1 does not propagate to depth ibecause it is in a set E(in fact, one\\nelement from each node at depth i−1 does not propagate to depth i).\\nWe can therefore bound the overall running time of an execution of quick-sort\\nasO(n·h)where his the overall height of the quick-sort tree Tfor that execution.\\nUnfortunately, in the worst case, the height of a quick-sort tree is Θ(n), as observed\\nin Section 12.3. Thus, quick-sort runs in O(n2)worst-case time. Paradoxically,\\nif we choose the pivot as the last element of the sequence, this worst-case behav-ior occurs for problem instances when sorting should be easy—if the sequence is\\nalready sorted.\\nGiven its name, we would expect quick-sort to run quickly, and it often does\\nin practice. The best case for quick-sort on a sequence of distinct elements oc-\\ncurs when subsequences Land Ghave roughly the same size. In that case, as\\nwe saw with merge-sort, the tree has height O(logn)and therefore quick-sort runs\\ninO(nlogn)time; we leave the justiﬁcation of this fact as an exercise (R-12.10).\\nMore so, we can observe an O(nlogn)running time even if the split between L\\nand Gis not as perfect. For example, if every divide step caused one subsequence\\nto have one-fourth of those elements and the other to have three-fourths of the\\nelements, the height of the tree would remain O(logn)and thus the overall perfor-\\nmance O(nlogn).\\nWe will see in the next section that introducing randomization in the choice of\\na pivot will makes quick-sort essentially behave in this way on average, with an\\nexpected running time that is O(nlogn).'),\n",

Quick-Sort 557\\n12.3.1 Randomized Quick-Sort\\nOne common method for analyzing quick-sort is to assume that the pivot will al-\\nways divide the sequence in a reasonably balanced manner. We feel such an as-sumption would presuppose knowledge about the input distribution that is typically\\nnot available, however. For example, we would have to assume that we will rarely\\nbe given “almost” sorted sequences to sort, which are actually common in manyapplications. Fortunately, this assumption is not needed in order for us to matchour intuition to quick-sort’s behavior.\\nIn general, we desire some way of getting close to the best-case running time\\nfor quick-sort. The way to get close to the best-case running time, of course, is forthe pivot to divide the input sequence Salmost equally. If this outcome were to\\noccur, then it would result in a running time that is asymptotically the same as thebest-case running time. That is, having pivots close to the “middle” of the set of\\nelements leads to an O(nlogn)running time for quick-sort.\\nPicking Pivots at Random\\nSince the goal of the partition step of the quick-sort method is to divide the sequence\\nSwith sufﬁcient balance, let us introduce randomization into the algorithm and pick\\nas the pivot a random element of the input sequence. That is, instead of picking\\nthe pivot as the ﬁrst or last element of S, we pick an element of Sat random as the\\npivot, keeping the rest of the algorithm unchanged. This variation of quick-sort iscalled randomized quick-sort . The following proposition shows that the expected\\nrunning time of randomized quick-sort on a sequence with nelements is O(nlogn).\\nThis expectation is taken over all the possible random choices the algorithm makes,and is independent of any assumptions about the distribution of the possible inputsequences the algorithm is likely to be given.\\nProposition 12.3:\\nThe expected running time of randomized quick-sort on a se-\\nquence Sof size nisO(nlogn).\\nJustiﬁcation: We assume two elements of Scan be compared in O(1)time.\\nConsider a single recursive call of randomized quick-sort, and let ndenote the size\\nof the input for this call. Say that this call is “good” if the pivot chosen is such that\\nsubsequences Land Ghave size at least n/4 and at most 3 n/4 each; otherwise, a\\ncall is “bad.”\\nNow, consider the implications of our choosing a pivot uniformly at random.\\nNote that there are n/2 possible good choices for the pivot for any given call of\\nsize nof the randomized quick-sort algorithm. Thus, the probability that any call is\\ngood is 1 /2. Note further that a good call will at least partition a list of size ninto\\ntwo lists of size 3 n/4a n d n/4, and a bad call could be as bad as producing a single\\ncall of size n−1.'),\n",

Sorting and Selection\\nNow consider a recursion trace for randomized quick-sort. This trace deﬁnes a\\nbinary tree, T, such that each node in Tcorresponds to a different recursive call on\\na subproblem of sorting a portion of the original list.\\nSay that a node vinTis in size group iif the size of v’s subproblem is greater\\nthan (3/4)i+1nand at most (3/4)in. Let us analyze the expected time spent working\\non all the subproblems for nodes in size group i. By the linearity of expectation\\n(Proposition B.19), the expected time for working on all these subproblems is the\\nsum of the expected times for each one. Some of these nodes correspond to goodcalls and some correspond to bad calls. But note that, since a good call occurs with\\nprobability 1 /2, the expected number of consecutive calls we have to make before\\ngetting a good call is 2. Moreover, notice that as soon as we have a good call for\\na node in size group i, its children will be in size groups higher than i. Thus, for\\nany element xfrom in the input list, the expected number of nodes in size group i\\ncontaining xin their subproblems is 2. In other words, the expected total size of all\\nthe subproblems in size group iis 2n. Since the nonrecursive work we perform for\\nany subproblem is proportional to its size, this implies that the total expected timespent processing subproblems for nodes in size group iisO(n).\\nThe number of size groups is log\\n4/3n, since repeatedly multiplying by 3 /4i s\\nthe same as repeatedly dividing by 4 /3. That is, the number of size groups is\\nO(logn). Therefore, the total expected running time of randomized quick-sort is\\nO(nlogn).

Quick-Sort 559\\n12.3.2 Additional Optimizations for Quick-Sort\\nAn algorithm is in-place if it uses only a small amount of memory in addition\\nto that needed for the original input. Our implementation of heap-sort, from Sec-\\ntion 9.4.2, is an example of such an in-place sorting algorithm.

Quick-sort of an array-based sequence can be adapted to be in-place, and suchan optimization is used in most deployed implementations.\\nPerforming the quick-sort algorithm in-place requires a bit of ingenuity, how-\\never, for we must use the input sequence itself to store the subsequences for all therecursive calls. We show algorithm inplace\\nquick\\n sort, which performs in-place\\nquick-sort, in Code Fragment 12.6. Our implementation assumes that the input\\nsequence, S, is given as a Python list of elements.

Quick-Sort 561\\nAlthough the implementation we describe in this section for dividing the se-\\nquence into two pieces is in-place, we note that the complete quick-sort algorithm\\nneeds space for a stack proportional to the depth of the recursion tree, which inthis case can be as large as n−1. Admittedly, the expected stack depth is O(logn),\\nwhich is small compared to n. Nevertheless, a simple trick lets us guarantee the\\nstack size is O(logn). The main idea is to design a nonrecursive version of in-place\\nquick-sort using an explicit stack to iteratively process subproblems (each of whichcan be represented with a pair of indices marking subarray boundaries). Each iter-ation involves popping the top subproblem, splitting it in two (if it is big enough),and pushing the two new subproblems. The trick is that when pushing the new\\nsubproblems, we should ﬁrst push the larger subproblem and then the smaller one.\\nIn this way, the sizes of the subproblems will at least double as we go down thestack; hence, the stack can have depth at most O(logn). We leave the details of this\\nimplementation as an exercise (P-12.56).\\nPivot Selection\\nOur implementation in this section blindly picks the last element as the pivot at eachlevel of the quick-sort recursion. This leaves it susceptible to the Θ(n\\n2)-time worst\\ncase, most notably when the original sequence is already sorted, reverse sorted, ornearly sorted.\\nAs described in Section 12.3.1, this can be improved upon by using a randomly\\nchosen pivot for each partition step. In practice, another common technique for\\nchoosing a pivot is to use the median of tree values, taken respectively from the\\nfront, middle, and tail of the array. This median-of-three heuristic will more often\\nchoose a good pivot and computing a median of three may require lower overheadthan selecting a pivot with a random number generator. For larger data sets, themedian of more than three potential pivots might be computed.\\nHybrid Approaches\\nAlthough quick-sort has very good performance on large data sets, it has ratherhigh overhead on relatively small data sets. For example, the process of quick-sorting a sequence of eight elements, as illustrated in Figures 12.10 through 12.12,\\ninvolves considerable bookkeeping. In practice, a simple algorithm like insertion-\\nsort (Section 7.5) will execute faster when sorting such a short sequence.\\nIt is therefore common, in optimized sorting implementations, to use a hybrid\\napproach, with a divide-and-conquer algorithm used until the size of a subsequencefalls below some threshold (perhaps 50 elements); insertion-sort can be directlyinvoked upon portions with length below the threshold. We will further discusssuch practical considerations in Section 12.5, when comparing the performance of\\nvarious sorting algorithms.'),\n",

Sorting and Selection\\n12.4 Studying Sorting through an Algorithmic Lens\\nRecapping our discussions on sorting to this point, we have described several meth-\\nods with either a worst case or expected running time of O(nlogn)on an input se-\\nquence of size n. These methods include merge-sort and quick-sort, described in\\nthis chapter, as well as heap-sort (Section 9.4.2). In this section, we study sortingas an algorithmic problem, addressing general issues about sorting algorithms.\\n12.4.1 Lower Bound for Sorting\\nA natural ﬁrst question to ask is whether we can sort any faster than O(nlogn)\\ntime. Interestingly, if the computational primitive used by a sorting algorithm is thecomparison of two elements, this is in fact the best we can do—comparison-basedsorting has an Ω(nlogn)worst-case lower bound on its running time. (Recall the\\nnotation Ω(·)from Section 3.3.1.) To focus on the main cost of comparison-based\\nsorting, let us only count comparisons, for the sake of a lower bound.\\nSuppose we are given a sequence S=( x\\n0,x1,..., xn−1)that we wish to sort,\\nand assume that all the elements of Sare distinct (this is not really a restriction\\nsince we are deriving a lower bound). We do not care if Sis implemented as an\\narray or a linked list, for the sake of our lower bound, since we are only countingcomparisons. Each time a sorting algorithm compares two elements x\\niand xj(that\\nis, it asks, “is xi<xj?”), there are two outcomes: “yes” or “no.” Based on the result\\nof this comparison, the sorting algorithm may perform some internal calculations(which we are not counting here) and will eventually perform another comparisonbetween two other elements of S, which again will have two outcomes. Therefore,\\nwe can represent a comparison-based sorting algorithm with a decision tree T(re-\\ncall Example 8.6). That is, each internal node vinTcorresponds to a comparison\\nand the edges from position vto its children correspond to the computations result-\\ning from either a “yes” or “no” answer. It is important to note that the hypotheticalsorting algorithm in question probably has no explicit knowledge of the tree T.T h e\\ntree simply represents all the possible sequences of comparisons that a sorting algo-\\nrithm might make, starting from the ﬁrst comparison (associated with the root) and\\nending with the last comparison (associated with the parent of an external node).\\nEach possible initial order, or permutation, of the elements in Swill cause\\nour hypothetical sorting algorithm to execute a series of comparisons, traversing apath in Tfrom the root to some external node. Let us associate with each external\\nnode vinT, then, the set of permutations of Sthat cause our sorting algorithm to\\nend up in v. The most important observation in our lower-bound argument is that\\neach external node vinTcan represent the sequence of comparisons for at most\\none permutation of S. The justiﬁcation for this claim is simple: If two different'),\n",

At the same time, the output associated with vmust be a speciﬁc reordering\\nofS, with either xiorxjappearing before the other. But if P1and P2both cause the\\nsorting algorithm to output the elements of Sin this order, then that implies there is\\na way to trick the algorithm into outputting xiand xjin the wrong order. Since this\\ncannot be allowed by a correct sorting algorithm, each external node of Tmust be\\nassociated with exactly one permutation of S.

Sorting and Selection\\n12.4.2 Linear-Time Sorting: Bucket-Sort and Radix-Sort\\nIn the previous section, we showed that Ω(nlogn)time is necessary, in the worst\\ncase, to sort an n-element sequence with a comparison-based sorting algorithm. A\\nnatural question to ask, then, is whether there are other kinds of sorting algorithms\\nthat can be designed to run asymptotically faster than O(nlogn)time. Interest-\\ningly, such algorithms exist, but they require special assumptions about the inputsequence to be sorted. Even so, such scenarios often arise in practice, such as whensorting integers from a known range or sorting character strings, so discussing themis worthwhile. In this section, we consider the problem of sorting a sequence of en-\\ntries, each a key-value pair, where the keys have a restricted type.\\nBucket-Sort\\nConsider a sequence Sofnentries whose keys are integers in the range [0,N−1],\\nfor some integer N≥2, and suppose that Sshould be sorted according to the keys\\nof the entries. In this case, it is possible to sort SinO(n+N)time. It might seem\\nsurprising, but this implies, for example, that if NisO(n), then we can sort Sin\\nO(n)time. Of course, the crucial point is that, because of the restrictive assumption\\nabout the format of the elements, we can avoid using comparisons.\\nThe main idea is to use an algorithm called bucket-sort , which is not based on\\ncomparisons, but on using keys as indices into a bucket array Bthat has cells in-\\ndexed from 0 to N−1. An entry with key kis placed in the “bucket” B[k],w h i c h\\nitself is a sequence (of entries with key k). After inserting each entry of the input\\nsequence Sinto its bucket, we can put the entries back into Sin sorted order by enu-\\nmerating the contents of the buckets B[0],B[1],..., B[N−1]in order. We describe\\nthe bucket-sort algorithm in Code Fragment 12.7.\\nAlgorithm bucketSort(S) :\\nInput: Sequence Sof entries with integer keys in the range [0,N−1]\\nOut\\nput: Sequence Ssorted in nondecreasing order of the keys\\nletBbe an array of Nsequences, each of which is initially empty\\nforeach entry einSdo\\nk=the key of e\\nremove efromSand insert it at the end of bucket (sequence) B[k]\\nfori=0t oN−1do\\nforeach entry ein sequence B[i]do\\nremove efromB[i]and insert it at the end of S\\nCode Fragment 12.7: Bucket-sort.'),\n",

Studying Sorting through an Algorithmic Lens 565\\nIt is easy to see that bucket-sort runs in O(n+N)time and uses O(n+N)\\nspace. Hence, bucket-sort is efﬁcient when the range Nof values for the keys is\\nsmall compared to the sequence size n, say N=O(n)orN=O(nlogn). Still, its\\nperformance deteriorates as Ngrows compared to n.\\nAn important property of the bucket-sort algorithm is that it works correctly\\neven if there are many different elements with the same key. Indeed, we described\\nit in a way that anticipates such occurrences.\\nStable Sorting\\nWhen sorting key-value pairs, an important issue is how equal keys are handled. LetS=( ( k\\n0,v0),..., (kn−1,vn−1))be a sequence of such entries. We say that a sorting\\nalgorithm is stable if, for any two entries (ki,vi)and (kj,vj)ofSsuch that ki=kj\\nand (ki,vi)precedes (kj,vj)inSbefore sorting (that is, i<j), entry (ki,vi)also\\nprecedes entry (kj,vj)after sorting. Stability is important for a sorting algorithm\\nbecause applications may want to preserve the initial order of elements with thesame key.\\nOur informal description of bucket-sort in Code Fragment 12.7 guarantees sta-\\nbility as long as we ensure that all sequences act as queues, with elements processedand removed from the front of a sequence and inserted at the back. That is, wheninitially placing elements of Sinto buckets, we should process Sfrom front to back,\\nand add each element to the end of its bucket. Subsequently, when transferring el-ements from the buckets back to S, we should process each B[i]from front to back,\\nwith those elements added to the end of S.\\nRadix-Sort\\nOne of the reasons that stable sorting is so important is that it allows the bucket-sort\\napproach to be applied to more general contexts than to sort integers. Suppose, for\\nexample, that we want to sort entries with keys that are pairs (k,l),w h e r e kand l\\nare integers in the range [0,N−1], for some integer N≥2. In a context such as this,\\nit is common to deﬁne an order on these keys using the lexicographic (dictionary)\\nconvention, where (k1,l1)<(k2,l2)ifk1<k2or if k1=k2and l1<l2(see page 15).\\nThis is a pairwise version of the lexicographic comparison function, which can beapplied to equal-length character strings, or to tuples of length d.\\nTheradix-sort algorithm sorts a sequence Sof entries with keys that are pairs,\\nby applying a stable bucket-sort on the sequence twice; ﬁrst using one componentof the pair as the key when ordering and then using the second component. Butwhich order is correct? Should we ﬁrst sort on the k’s (the ﬁrst component) and\\nthen on the l’s (the second component), or should it be the other way around?'),\n",

Sorting and Selection\\nTo gain intuition before answering this question, we consider the following\\nexample.\\nExample 12.5: Consider the following sequence S(we show only the keys):\\nS=( (3,3),(1,5),(2,5),(1,2),(2,3),(1,7),(3,2),(2,2)).\\nIf we sort Sstably on the ﬁrst component, then we get the sequence\\nS1=( (1,5),(1,2),(1,7),(2,5),(2,3),(2,2),(3,3),(3,2)).\\nIf we then stably sort this sequence S1using the second component, we get the\\nsequence\\nS1,2=( (1,2),(2,2),(3,2),(2,3),(3,3),(1,5),(2,5),(1,7)),\\nwhich is unfortunately not a sorted sequence. On the other hand, if we ﬁrst stably\\nsort Susing the second component, then we get the sequence\\nS2=( (1,2),(3,2),(2,2),(3,3),(2,3),(1,5),(2,5),(1,7)).\\nIf we then stably sort sequence S2using the ﬁrst component, we get the sequence\\nS2,1=( (1,2),(1,5),(1,7),(2,2),(2,3),(2,5),(3,2),(3,3)),\\nwhich is indeed sequence Slexicographically ordered.\\nSo, from this example, we are led to believe that we should ﬁrst sort using\\nthe second component and then again using the ﬁrst component. This intuition is\\nexactly right. By ﬁrst stably sorting by the second component and then again bythe ﬁrst component, we guarantee that if two entries are equal in the second sort(by the ﬁrst component), then their relative order in the starting sequence (which\\nis sorted by the second component) is preserved. Thus, the resulting sequence is\\nguaranteed to be sorted lexicographically every time. We leave to a simple exercise(R-12.18) the determination of how this approach can be extended to triples andother d-tuples of numbers. We can summarize this section as follows:\\nProposition 12.6:\\nLet Sbe a sequence of nkey-value pairs, each of which has a\\nkey (k1,k2,..., kd),w h e r e kiis an integer in the range [0,N−1]for some integer\\nN≥2. We can sort Slexicographically in time O(d(n+N))using radix-sort.\\nRadix sort can be applied to any key that can be viewed as a composite of\\nsmaller pieces that are to be sorted lexicographically. For example, we can applyit to sort character strings of moderate length, as each individual character can berepresented as an integer value. (Some care is needed to properly handle strings\\nwith varying lengths.)'),\n",

Comparing Sorting Algorithms 567\\n12.5 Comparing Sorting Algorithms\\nAt this point, it might be useful for us to take a moment and consider all the algo-\\nrithms we have studied in this book to sort an n-element sequence.\\nConsidering Running Time and Other Factors\\nWe have studied several methods, such as insertion-sort, and selection-sort, thathave O(n\\n2)-time behavior in the average and worst case. We have also studied sev-\\neral methods with O(nlogn)-time behavior, including heap-sort, merge-sort, and\\nquick-sort. Finally, the bucket-sort and radix-sort methods run in linear time forcertain types of keys. Certainly, the selection-sort algorithm is a poor choice in anyapplication, since it runs in O(n\\n2)time even in the best case. But, of the remaining\\nsorting algorithms, which is the best?\\nAs with many things in life, there is no clear “best” sorting algorithm from\\nthe remaining candidates. There are trade-offs involving efﬁciency, memory usage,and stability. The sorting algorithm best suited for a particular application dependson the properties of that application. In fact, the default sorting algorithm usedby computing languages and systems has evolved greatly over time. We can offer\\nsome guidance and observations, therefore, based on the known properties of the\\n“good” sorting algorithms.\\nInsertion-Sort\\nIf implemented well, the running time of insertion-sort isO(n+m),w h e r e mis\\nthe number of inversions (that is, the number of pairs of elements out of order).\\nThus, insertion-sort is an excellent algorithm for sorting small sequences (say, lessthan 50 elements), because insertion-sort is simple to program, and small sequencesnecessarily have few inversions. Also, insertion-sort is quite effective for sorting\\nsequences that are already “almost” sorted. By “almost,” we mean that the number\\nof inversions is small. But the O(n\\n2)-time performance of insertion-sort makes it a\\npoor choice outside of these special contexts.\\nHeap-Sort\\nHeap-sort , on the other hand, runs in O(nlogn)time in the worst case, which is\\noptimal for comparison-based sorting methods. Heap-sort can easily be made to ex-ecute in-place, and is a natural choice on small- and medium-sized sequences, wheninput data can ﬁt into main memory. However, heap-sort tends to be outperformedby both quick-sort and merge-sort on larger sequences. A standard heap-sort does\\nnot provide a stable sort, because of the swapping of elements.'),\n",

Sorting and Selection\\nQuick-Sort\\nAlthough its O(n2)-time worst-case performance makes quick-sort susceptible in\\nreal-time applications where we must make guarantees on the time needed to com-\\nplete a sorting operation, we expect its performance to be O(nlogn)-time, and ex-\\nperimental studies have shown that it outperforms both heap-sort and merge-sort on\\nmany tests. Quick-sort does not naturally provide a stable sort, due to the swappingof elements during the partitioning step.\\nFor decades quick-sort was the default choice for a general-purpose, in-memory\\nsorting algorithm. Quick-sort was included as the qsort sorting utility provided in C\\nlanguage libraries, and was the basis for sorting utilities on Unix operating systems\\nfor many years. It was also the standard algorithm for sorting arrays in Java through\\nversion 6 of that language. (We discuss Java7 below.)\\nMerge-Sort\\nMerge-sort runs in O(nlogn)time in the worst case. It is quite difﬁcult to make\\nmerge-sort run in-place for arrays, and without that optimization the extra overheadof allocate a temporary array, and copying between the arrays is less attractive thanin-place implementations of heap-sort and quick-sort for sequences that can ﬁt en-\\ntirely in a computer’s main memory. Even so, merge-sort is an excellent algorithm\\nfor situations where the input is stratiﬁed across various levels of the computer’smemory hierarchy (e.g., cache, main memory, external memory). In these contexts,the way that merge-sort processes runs of data in long merge streams makes the best\\nuse of all the data brought as a block into a level of memory, thereby reducing the\\ntotal number of memory transfers.\\nThe GNU sorting utility (and most current versions of the Linux operating sys-\\ntem) relies on a multiway merge-sort variant. Since 2003, the standard sortmethod\\nof Python’s listclass has been a hybrid approach named Tim-sort (designed by Tim\\nPeters), which is essentially a bottom-up merge-sort that takes advantage of someinitial runs in the data while using insertion-sort to build additional runs. Tim-sort\\nhas also become the default algorithm for sorting arrays in Java7.\\nBucket-Sort and Radix-Sort\\nFinally, if an application involves sorting entries with small integer keys, character\\nstrings, or d-tuples of keys from a discrete range, then bucket-sort orradix-sort is\\nan excellent choice, for it runs in O(d(n+N))time, where [0,N−1]is the range of\\ninteger keys (and d=1 for bucket sort). Thus, if d(n+N)is signiﬁcantly “below”\\nthe nlognfunction, then this sorting method should run faster than even quick-sort,\\nheap-sort, or merge-sort.'),\n",

Python’s Built-In Sorting Functions 569\\n12.6 Python’s Built-In Sorting Functions\\nPython provides two built-in ways to sort data. The ﬁrst is the sortmethod of the\\nlistclass. As an example, suppose that we deﬁne the following list:\\ncolors = [\\n red\\n,\\ngreen\\n ,\\nblue\\n ,\\ncyan\\n ,\\nmagenta\\n ,\\nyellow\\n ]\\nThat method has the effect of reordering the elements of the list into order, as de-\\nﬁned by the natural meaning of the <operator for those elements. In the above\\nexample, within elements that are strings, the natural order is deﬁned alphabeti-cally. Therefore, after a call to colors.sort() , the order of the list would become:\\n[\\nblue\\n ,\\ncyan\\n ,\\ngreen\\n ,\\nmagenta\\n ,\\nred\\n,\\nyellow\\n ]\\nPython also supports a built-in function, named sorted , that can be used to\\nproduce a new ordered list containing the elements of any existing iterable con-\\ntainer. Going back to our original example, the syntax sorted(colors) would return\\na new list of those colors, in alphabetical order, while leaving the contents of the\\noriginal list unchanged. This second form is more general because it can be ap-plied to any iterable object as a parameter; for example, sorted(\\ngreen\\n )returns\\n[\\ne\\n,\\ne\\n,\\ng\\n,\\nn\\n,\\nr\\n].\\n12.6.1 Sorting According to a Key Function\\nThere are many situations in which we wish to sort a list of elements, but accordingto some order other than the natural order deﬁned by the <operator. For example,\\nwe might wish to sort a list of strings from shortest to longest (rather than alphabet-ically). Both of Python’s built-in sort functions allow a caller to control the notionof order that is used when sorting. This is accomplished by providing, as an op-tional keyword parameter, a reference to a secondary function that computes a key\\nfor each element of the primary sequence; then the primary elements are sortedbased on the natural order of their keys. (See pages 27 and 28 of Section 1.5.1 fora discussion of this technique in the context of the built-in minandmax functions.)\\nA key function must be a one-parameter function that accepts an element as a\\nparameter and returns a key. For example, we could use the built-in lenfunction\\nwhen sorting strings by length, as a call len(s) for string sreturns its length. To sort\\nourcolors list based on length, we use the syntax colors.sort(key=len) to mutate\\nthe list or sorted(colors, key=len) to generate a new ordered list, while leaving the\\noriginal alone. When sorted with the length function as a key, the contents are:\\n[\\nred\\n,\\nblue\\n ,\\ncyan\\n ,\\ngreen\\n ,\\nyellow\\n ,\\nmagenta\\n ]\\nThese built-in functions also support a keyword parameter, reverse , that can be\\nset toTrue to cause the sort order to be from largest to smallest.'),\n",

Sorting and Selection\\nDecorate-Sort-Undecorate Design Pattern\\nPython’s support for a key function when sorting is implemented using what is\\nknown as the decorate-sort-undecorate design pattern . It proceeds in 3 steps:\\n1. Each element of the list is temporarily replaced with a “decorated” version\\nthat includes the result of the key function applied to the element.\\n2. The list is sorted based upon the natural order of the keys (Figure 12.16).3. The decorated elements are replaced by the original elements.\\n1 0 23456 3 44 blue 5 green\\nred yellow7 magenta\\ncyan\\nFigure 12.16: A list of “decorated” strings, using their lengths as decoration. This\\nlist has been sorted by those keys.\\nAlthough there is already built-in support for Python, if we were to implement\\nsuch a strategy ourselves, a natural way to represent a “decorated” element is usingthe same composition strategy that we used for representing key-value pairs within\\na priority queue. Code Fragment 9.1 of Section 9.2.1 includes just such an\\nItem\\nclass, deﬁned so that the <operator for items relies upon the given keys. With such\\na composition, we could trivially adapt any sorting algorithm to use the decorate-\\nsort-undecorate pattern, as demonstrated in Code Fragment 12.8 with merge-sort.\\n1defdecorated\\n merge\\n sort(data, key= None):\\n2”””Demonstration of the decorate-sort-undecorate pattern.”””\\n3ifkeyis not None :\\n4 forjinrange(len(data)):\\n5 data[j] =\\n Item(key(data[j]), data[j]) # decorate each element\\n6merge\\n sort(data) # sort with existing algorithm\\n7ifkeyis not None :\\n8 forjinrange(len(data)):\\n9 data[j] = data[j].\\n value # undecorate each element\\nCode Fragment 12.8: An approach for implementing the decorate-sort-undecorate\\npattern based upon the array-based merge-sort of Code Fragment 12.1.

Selection 571\\n12.7 Selection\\nAs important as it is, sorting is not the only interesting problem dealing with a total\\norder relation on a set of elements. There are a number of applications in whichwe are interested in identifying a single element in terms of its rank relative tothe sorted order of the entire set. Examples include identifying the minimum and\\nmaximum elements, but we may also be interested in, say, identifying the median\\nelement, that is, the element such that half of the other elements are smaller and the\\nremaining half are larger. In general, queries that ask for an element with a givenrank are called order statistics .\\nDeﬁning the Selection Problem\\nIn this section, we discuss the general order-statistic problem of selecting the kth\\nsmallest element from an unsorted collection of ncomparable elements. This is\\nknown as the selection problem. Of course, we can solve this problem by sorting\\nthe collection and then indexing into the sorted sequence at index k−1. Using\\nthe best comparison-based sorting algorithms, this approach would take O(nlogn)\\ntime, which is obviously an overkill for the cases where k=1o r k=n(or even\\nk=2,k=3,k=n−1, or k=n−5), because we can easily solve the selection\\nproblem for these values of kinO(n)time. Thus, a natural question to ask is\\nwhether we can achieve an O(n)running time for all values of k(including the\\ninteresting case of ﬁnding the median, where k=⌊n/2⌋).\\n12.7.1 Prune-and-Search\\nWe can indeed solve the selection problem in O(n)time for any value of k.M o r e -\\nover, the technique we use to achieve this result involves an interesting algorithmic\\ndesign pattern. This design pattern is known as prune-and-search ordecrease-\\nand-conquer . In applying this design pattern, we solve a given problem that is\\ndeﬁned on a collection of nobjects by pruning away a fraction of the nobjects\\nand recursively solving the smaller problem. When we have ﬁnally reduced theproblem to one deﬁned on a constant-sized collection of objects, we then solve\\nthe problem using some brute-force method. Returning back from all the recursivecalls completes the construction. In some cases, we can avoid using recursion, inwhich case we simply iterate the prune-and-search reduction step until we can ap-ply a brute-force method and stop. Incidentally, the binary search method described\\nin Section 4.1.3 is an example of the prune-and-search design pattern.'),\n",

Sorting and Selection\\n12.7.2 Randomized Quick-Select\\nIn applying the prune-and-search pattern to ﬁnding the kthsmallest element in an\\nunordered sequence of nelements, we describe a simple and practical algorithm,\\nknown as randomized quick-select . This algorithm runs in O(n)expected time,\\ntaken over all possible random choices made by the algorithm; this expectation\\ndoes not depend whatsoever on any randomness assumptions about the input dis-tribution. We note though that randomized quick-select runs in O(n\\n2)time in the\\nworst case , the justiﬁcation of which is left as an exercise (R-12.24). We also\\nprovide an exercise (C-12.55) for modifying randomized quick-select to deﬁne adeterministic selection algorithm that runs in O(n)worst-case time. The existence\\nof this deterministic algorithm is mostly of theoretical interest, however, since theconstant factor hidden by the big-Oh notation is relatively large in that case.\\nSuppose we are given an unsorted sequence Sofncomparable elements to-\\ngether with an integer k∈[1,n]. At a high level, the quick-select algorithm for\\nﬁnding the k\\nthsmallest element in Sis similar to the randomized quick-sort algo-\\nrithm described in Section 12.3.1. We pick a “pivot” element from Sat random and\\nuse this to subdivide Sinto three subsequences L,E,a n d G, storing the elements of\\nSless than, equal to, and greater than the pivot, respectively. In the prune step, we\\ndetermine which of these subsets contains the desired element, based on the valueofkand the sizes of those subsets. We then recur on the appropriate subset, noting\\nthat the desired element’s rank in the subset may differ from its rank in the full set.An implementation of randomized quick-select is shown in Code Fragment 12.9.\\n1defquick\\nselect(S, k):\\n2”””Return the kth smallest element of list S, for k from 1 to len(S).”””\\n3iflen(S) == 1:\\n4 return S[0]\\n5pivot = random.choice(S) # pick random pivot element from S\\n6L=[ x forxinSifx<pivot] # elements less than pivot\\n7E=[ x forxinSifx= =p i v o t ] # elements equal to pivot\\n8G=[ x forxinSifpivot<x] # elements greater than pivot\\n9ifk<= len(L):\\n10 return quick\\n select(L, k) # kth smallest lies in L\\n11elifk<=l e n ( L )+l e n ( E ) :\\n12 return pivot # kth smallest equal to pivot\\n13else:\\n14 j=k −len(L) −len(E) # new selection parameter\\n15 return quick\\n select(G, j) # kth smallest is jth in G\\nCode Fragment 12.9: Randomized quick-select algorithm.'),\n",

Selection 573\\n12.7.3 Analyzing Randomized Quick-Select\\nShowing that randomized quick-select runs in O(n)time requires a simple prob-\\nabilistic argument. The argument is based on the linearity of expectation ,w h i c h\\nstates that if Xand Yare random variables and cis a number, then\\nE(X+Y)= E(X)+ E(Y) and E(cX)= cE(X),\\nwhere we use E(Z)to denote the expected value of the expression Z.\\nLet t(n)be the running time of randomized quick-select on a sequence of size n.\\nSince this algorithm depends on random events, its running time, t(n), is a random\\nvariable. We want to bound E(t(n)), the expected value of t(n). Say that a recursive\\ninvocation of our algorithm is “good” if it partitions Sso that the size of each of L\\nand Gis at most 3 n/4. Clearly, a recursive call is good with probability at least 1 /2.\\nLet g(n)denote the number of consecutive recursive calls we make, including the\\npresent one, before we get a good one. Then we can characterize t(n)using the\\nfollowing recurrence equation :\\nt(n)≤bn·g(n)+ t(3n/4),\\nwh\\nere b≥1 is a constant. Applying the linearity of expectation for n>1, we get\\nE(t(n))≤E(bn·g(n)+ t(3n/4)) = bn·E(g(n)) + E(t(3n/4)).\\nSince a recursive call is good with probability at least 1 /2, and whether a recursive\\ncall is good or not is independent of its parent call being good, the expected value\\nofg(n)is at most the expected number of times we must ﬂip a fair coin before it\\ncomes up “heads.” That is, E(g(n))≤2. Thus, if we let T(n)be shorthand for\\nE(t(n)), then we can write the case for n>1a s\\nT(n)≤T(3n/4)+2bn.\\nT\\no convert this relation into a closed form, let us iteratively apply this inequality\\nassuming nis large. So, for example, after two applications,\\nT(n)≤T((3/4)2n)+2b(3/4)n+2bn.\\nAt this point, we should see that the general case is\\nT(n)≤2bn·⌈log4/3n⌉\\n∑\\ni=0(3/4)i.\\nIn other words, the expected running time is at most 2 bntimes a geometric sum\\nwhose base is a positive number less than 1. Thus, by Proposition 3.5, T(n)isO(n).\\nProposition 12.7: The expected running time of randomized quick-select on a\\nsequence Sof size nisO(n), assuming two elements of Scan be compared in O(1)\\ntime.'),\n",

Text Processing\\n13.1 Abundance of Digitized Text\\nDespite the wealth of multimedia information, text processing remains one of the\\ndominant functions of computers. Computer are used to edit, store, and displaydocuments, and to transport documents over the Internet. Furthermore, digital sys-\\ntems are used to archive a wide range of textual information, and new data is being\\ngenerated at a rapidly increasing pace. A large corpus can readily surpass a petabyteof data (which is equivalent to a thousand terabytes, or a million gigabytes). Com-mon examples of digital collections that include textual information are:\\n•Snapshots of the World Wide Web, as Internet document formats HTML andXML are primarily text formats, with added tags for multimedia content\\n•All documents stored locally on a user’s computer\\n•Email archives\\n•Customer reviews\\n•Compilations of status updates on social networking sites such as Facebook\\n•Feeds from microblogging sites such as Twitter and Tumblr\\nThese collections include written text from hundreds of international languages.\\nFurthermore, there are large data sets (such as DNA) that can be viewed computa-\\ntionally as “strings” even though they are not language.\\nIn this chapter we explore some of the fundamental algorithms that can be used\\nto efﬁciently analyze and process large textual data sets. In addition to having\\ninteresting applications, text-processing algorithms also highlight some important\\nalgorithmic design patterns.\\nWe begin by examining the problem of searching for a pattern as a substring\\nof a larger piece of text, for example, when searching for a word in a document.\\nThe pattern-matching problem gives rise to the brute-force method , which is often\\ninefﬁcient but has wide applicability.\\nNext, we introduce an algorithmic technique known as dynamic programming ,\\nwhich can be applied in certain settings to solve a problem in polynomial time that\\nappears at ﬁrst to require exponential time to solve. We demonstrate the applicationon this technique to the problem of ﬁnding partial matches between strings that may\\nbe similar but not perfectly aligned. This problem arises when making suggestions\\nfor a misspelled word, or when trying to match related genetic samples.\\nBecause of the massive size of textual data sets, the issue of compression is\\nimportant, both in minimizing the number of bits that need to be communicated\\nthrough a network and to reduce the long-term storage requirements for archives.\\nFor text compression, we can apply the greedy method , which often allows us to\\napproximate solutions to hard problems, and for some problems (such as in textcompression) actually gives rise to optimal algorithms.\\nFinally, we examine several special-purpose data structures that can be used to\\nbetter organize textual data in order to support more efﬁcient run-time queries.'),\n",

Abundance of Digitized Text 583\\n13.1.1 Notations for Strings and the Python str Class\\nWe use character strings as a model for text when discuss algorithms for text pro-\\ncessing. Character strings can come from a wide variety of sources, includingscientiﬁc, linguistic, and Internet applications. Indeed, the following are examplesof such strings:\\nS =\"CGTAAACTGCTTTAATCAAACGC\"\\nT =\"http://www.wiley.com\"\\nThe ﬁrst string, S, comes from DNA applications, and the second string, T,i st h e\\nInternet address (URL) for the publisher of this book. We refer to Appendix A foran overview of the operations supported by Python’s strclass.\\nTo allow fairly general notions of a string in our algorithm descriptions, we\\nonly assume that characters of a string come from a known alphabet ,w h i c hw e\\ndenote as Σ. For example, in the context of DNA, there are four symbols in the\\nstandard alphabet, Σ={A,C,G,T}. This alphabet Σcan, of course, be a subset of\\nthe ASCII or Unicode character sets, but it could also be something more general.\\nAlthough we assume that an alphabet has a ﬁxed ﬁnite size, denoted as |Σ|,t h a t\\nsize can be nontrivial, as with Python’s treatment of the Unicode alphabet, whichallows for more than a million distinct characters. We therefore consider the impact\\nof|Σ|in our asymptotic analysis of text-processing algorithms.\\nSeveral string-processing operations involve breaking large strings into smaller\\nstrings. In order to be able to speak about the pieces that result from such oper-\\nations, we will rely on Python’s indexing andslicing notations. For the sake of\\nnotation, we let Sdenote a string of length n. In that case, we let S[j]refer to the\\ncharacter at index jfor 0≤j≤n−1. We let notation S[j:k] for 0≤j≤k≤ndenote\\nthe slice (or substring )o fSconsisting of characters S[j]up to and including S[k−1],\\nbut not S[k]. By this deﬁnition, note that substring S [ j:j+m ] has length mand\\nthat substring S\\n [j:j]is trivially the null string , having length 0. In accordance with\\nPython conventions, the substring S[j:k] is also the null string when k<j.\\nIn order to distinguish some special kinds of substrings, let us refer to any\\nsubstring of the form S[0:k] for 0≤k≤nas apreﬁx ofS; such a preﬁx results in\\nPython when the ﬁrst index is omitted from slice notation, as in S[:k] . Similarly,\\nany substring of the form S[j:n] for 0≤j≤nis asufﬁx ofS; such a sufﬁx results\\nin Python when the second index is omitted from slice notation, as in S[j:].F o r\\nexample, if we again take Sto be the string of DNA given above, then \"CGTAA\" is\\nap r e ﬁ xo f S,\"CGC\" is a sufﬁx of S,a n d \"C\"is both a preﬁx and sufﬁx of S.N o t e\\nthat the null string is a preﬁx and a sufﬁx of any string.'),\n",

Text Processing\\n13.2.2 The Boyer-Moore Algorithm\\nAt ﬁrst, it might seem that it is always necessary to examine every character in Tin\\norder to locate a pattern Pas a substring or to rule out its existence. But this is not\\nalways the case. The Boyer-Moore pattern-matching algorithm, which we study in\\nthis section, can sometimes avoid comparisons between Pand a sizable fraction of\\nthe characters in T. In this section, we describe a simpliﬁed version of the original\\nalgorithm by Boyer and Moore.\\nThe main idea of the Boyer-Moore algorithm is to improve the running time of\\nthe brute-force algorithm by adding two potentially time-saving heuristics. Roughly\\nstated, these heuristics are as follows:\\nLooking-Glass Heuristic :When testing a possible placement of Pagainst T,b e -\\ngin the comparisons from the end of Pand move backward to the front of P.\\nCharacter-Jump Heuristic :During the testing of a possible placement of Pwithin\\nT, a mismatch of text character T[i]=c with the corresponding pattern char-\\nacterP[k] is handled as follows. If cis not contained anywhere in P,t h e n\\nshiftPcompletely past T[i](for it cannot match any character in P). Other-\\nwise, shift Puntil an occurrence of character cinPgets aligned with T[i].\\nWe will formalize these heuristics shortly, but at an intuitive level, they work as an\\nintegrated team. The looking-glass heuristic sets up the other heuristic to allow usto avoid comparisons between Pand whole groups of characters in T. In this case at\\nleast, we can get to the destination faster by going backwards, for if we encounter a\\nmismatch during the consideration of Pat a certain location in T, then we are likely\\nto avoid lots of needless comparisons by signiﬁcantly shifting Prelative to Tusing\\nthe character-jump heuristic. The character-jump heuristic pays off big if it can be\\napplied early in the testing of a potential placement of Pagainst T. Figure 13.2\\ndemonstrates a few simple applications of these heuristics.\\nsi·\\nPattern:· · · · · s· · · e · ·· ·· · Text: ·· ·\\nh u ssi\\nh u ssi\\nh us\\nFigure 13.2: A simple example demonstrating the intuition of the Boyer-Moore\\npattern-matching algorithm.

Pattern-Matching Algorithms 587\\nThe example of Figure 13.2 is rather basic, because it only involves mismatches\\nwith the last character of the pattern. More generally, when a match is found for\\nthat last character, the algorithm continues by trying to extend the match with thesecond-to-last character of the pattern in its current alignment. That process contin-ues until either matching the entire pattern, or ﬁnding a mismatch at some interiorposition of the pattern.\\nIf a mismatch is found, and the mismatched character of the text does not occur\\nin the pattern, we shift the entire pattern beyond that location, as originally illus-\\ntrated in Figure 13.2. If the mismatched character occurs elsewhere in the pattern,\\nwe must consider two possible subcases depending on whether its last occurrenceis before or after the character of the pattern that was aligned with the mismatched.Those two cases are illustrated in Figure 13.3.\\n(a)\\n·\\n· b· ·\\nk ji′\\n·a·· ·\\n· b· ·\\nj+1m−(j+1)Text:\\nPattern:· · · · · a· · · · · · · ·· ·\\ni\\na·\\n(b)·\\nkji′\\n·· b· · a\\n·· b· · a\\nkm−kText:\\nPattern:·· · · · · · · a· · · · · · · ·· ·\\ni\\nFigure 13.3: Additional rules for the character-jump heuristic of the Boyer-Moore\\nalgorithm.

The efﬁciency of the Boyer-Moore algorithm relies on creat-\\ning a lookup table that quickly determines where a mismatched character occurs\\nelsewhere in the pattern. In particular, we deﬁne a function last (c)as\\n•Ifcis inP,last (c)is the index of the last (rightmost) occurrence of cinP.\\nOtherwise, we conventionally deﬁne last (c)=−1.\\nIf we assume that the alphabet is of ﬁxed, ﬁnite size, and that characters can be\\nconverted to indices of an array (for example, by using their character code), the\\nlastfunction can be easily implemented as a lookup table with worst-case O(1)-\\ntime access to the value last (c). However, the table would have length equal to the\\nsize of the alphabet (rather than the size of the pattern), and time would be required\\nto initialize the entire table.\\nWe prefer to use a hash table to represent the lastfunction, with only those\\ncharacters from the pattern occurring in the structure. The space usage for thisapproach is proportional to the number of distinct alphabet symbols that occur in\\nthe pattern, and thus O(m). The expected lookup time remains independent of the\\nproblem (although the worst-case bound is O(m)).

For a certain alignment ofthe pattern, if we ﬁnd several matching characters but then detect a mismatch, weignore all the information gained by the successful comparisons after restarting\\nwith the next incremental placement of the pattern.\\nThe Knuth-Morris-Pratt (or “KMP”) algorithm, discussed in this section, avoids\\nthis waste of information and, in so doing, it achieves a running time of O(n+m),\\nwhich is asymptotically optimal. That is, in the worst case any pattern-matching\\nalgorithm will have to examine all the characters of the text and all the charactersof the pattern at least once. The main idea of the KMP algorithm is to precom-\\npute self-overlaps between portions of the pattern so that when a mismatch occurs\\nat one location, we immediately know the maximum amount to shift the patternbefore continuing the search. A motivating example is shown in Figure 13.5.\\na ··········\\na m\\namt o n i maag a lto ni maag a l· t\\namt o n i maag a lText:\\nPattern:aa m a g l a m c\\nFigure 13.5: A motivating example for the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm.

Intuitively, if we ﬁnd a mismatch upon character P[k+1] , the function\\nf(k)tells us how many of the immediately preceding characters can be reused to\\nrestart the pattern.

Text Processing\\n13.3 Dynamic Programming\\nIn this section, we discuss the dynamic programming algorithm-design technique.\\nThis technique is similar to the divide-and-conquer technique (Section 12.2.1), in\\nthat it can be applied to a wide variety of different problems. Dynamic program-\\nming can often be used to take problems that seem to require exponential time and\\nproduce polynomial-time algorithms to solve them. In addition, the algorithms thatresult from applications of the dynamic programming technique are usually quitesimple—often needing little more than a few lines of code to describe some nested\\nloops for ﬁlling in a table.\\n13.3.1 Matrix Chain-Product\\nRather than starting out with an explanation of the general components of the dy-\\nnamic programming technique, we begin by giving a classic, concrete example.\\nSuppose we are given a collection of ntwo-dimensional matrices for which we\\nwish to compute the mathematical product\\nA=A0·A1·A2···An−1,\\nwhere Aiis a di×di+1matrix, for i=0,1,2,..., n−1. In the standard matrix\\nmultiplication algorithm (which is the one we will use), to multiply a d×e-matrix B\\ntimes an e×f-matrix C, we compute the product, A,a s\\nA[i][j]=e−1\\n∑\\nk=0B[i][k]·C[k][j].\\nThis deﬁnition implies that matrix multiplication is associative, that is, it impliesthat B·(C·D)=( B·C)·D. Thus, we can parenthesize the expression for Aany\\nway we wish and we will end up with the same answer. However, we will not\\nnecessarily perform the same number of primitive (that is, scalar) multiplicationsin each parenthesization, as is illustrated in the following example.\\nExample 13.4:\\nLet Bbe a 2×10-matrix, let Cbe a 10×50-matrix, and let Dbe\\na50×20-matrix. Computing B·(C·D)requires 2·10·20+10·50·20 =10400\\nmultiplications, whereas computing (B·C)·Drequires 2·10·50+2·50·20=3000\\nmultiplications.\\nThematrix chain-product problem is to determine the parenthesization of the\\nexpression deﬁning the product Athat minimizes the total number of scalar mul-\\ntiplications performed. As the example above illustrates, the differences between\\nparenthesizations can be dramatic, so ﬁnding a good solution can result in signiﬁ-\\ncant speedups.'),\n",

Dynamic Programming 595\\nDeﬁning Subproblems\\nOne way to solve the matrix chain-product problem is to simply enumerate all the\\npossible ways of parenthesizing the expression for Aand determine the number\\nof multiplications performed by each one. Unfortunately, the set of all differentparenthesizations of the expression for Ais equal in number to the set of all dif-\\nferent binary trees that have nleaves. This number is exponential in n. Thus, this\\nstraightforward (“brute-force”) algorithm runs in exponential time, for there are anexponential number of ways to parenthesize an associative arithmetic expression.\\nWe can signiﬁcantly improve the performance achieved by the brute-force al-\\ngorithm, however, by making a few observations about the nature of the matrix\\nchain-product problem. The ﬁrst is that the problem can be split into subproblems .\\nIn this case, we can deﬁne a number of different subproblems, each of which is tocompute the best parenthesization for some subexpression A\\ni·Ai+1···Aj. As a con-\\ncise notation, we use Ni,jto denote the minimum number of multiplications needed\\nto compute this subexpression. Thus, the original matrix chain-product problemcan be characterized as that of computing the value of N\\n0,n−1. This observation\\nis important, but we need one more in order to apply the dynamic programming\\ntechnique.\\nCharacterizing Optimal Solutions\\nThe other important observation we can make about the matrix chain-product prob-lem is that it is possible to characterize an optimal solution to a particular subprob-lem in terms of optimal solutions to its subproblems. We call this property thesubproblem optimality condition.\\nIn the case of the matrix chain-product problem, we observe that, no mat-\\nter how we parenthesize a subexpression, there has to be some ﬁnal matrix mul-tiplication that we perform. That is, a full parenthesization of a subexpression\\nA\\ni·Ai+1···Ajhas to be of the form (Ai···Ak)·(Ak+1···Aj),f o rs o m e k∈{ i,i+\\n1,..., j−1}. Moreover, for whichever kis the correct one, the products (Ai···Ak)\\nand (Ak+1···Aj)must also be solved optimally. If this were not so, then there would\\nbe a global optimal that had one of these subproblems solved suboptimally. But thisis impossible, since we could then reduce the total number of multiplications by re-\\nplacing the current subproblem solution by an optimal solution for the subproblem.This observation implies a way of explicitly deﬁning the optimization problem forN\\ni,jin terms of other optimal subproblem solutions. Namely, we can compute Ni,j\\nby considering each place kwhere we could put the ﬁnal multiplication and taking\\nthe minimum over all such choices.'),\n",

That is, Ni,jis the\\nminimum, taken over all possible places to perform the ﬁnal multiplication, of the\\nnumber of multiplications needed to compute each subexpression plus the number\\nof multiplications needed to perform the ﬁnal matrix multiplication.\\nNotice that there is a sharing of subproblems going on that prevents us from\\ndividing the problem into completely independent subproblems (as we would need\\nto do to apply the divide-and-conquer technique).

In a genetics application,\\nthe two strings could correspond to two strands of DNA, for which we want to com-\\npute similarities. Likewise, in a software engineering application, the two stringscould come from two versions of source code for the same program, for which wewant to determine changes made from one version to the next. Indeed, determining\\nthe similarity between two strings is so common that the Unix and Linux operating\\nsystems have a built-in program, named diff, for comparing text ﬁles.\\nGiven a string X=x\\n0x1x2···xn−1,asubsequence ofXis any string that is of\\nthe form xi1xi2···xik,w h e r e ij<ij+1; that is, it is a sequence of characters that are\\nnot necessarily contiguous but are nevertheless taken in order from X. For example,\\nthe string AAAG is a subsequence of the string CGA\\n TA A\\n TTG\\n AGA .\\nThe DNA and text similarity problem we address here is the longest common\\nsubsequence (LCS) problem. In this problem, we are given two character strings,\\nX=x0x1x2···xn−1and Y=y0y1y2···ym−1, over some alphabet (such as the alpha-\\nbet{A,C,G,T}common in computational genetics) and are asked to ﬁnd a longest\\nstring Sthat is a subsequence of both Xand Y. One way to solve the longest\\ncommon subsequence problem is to enumerate all subsequences of Xand take the\\nlargest one that is also a subsequence of Y. Since each character of Xis either in\\nor not in a subsequence, there are potentially 2ndifferent subsequences of X, each\\nof which requires O(m)time to determine whether it is a subsequence of Y.

Text Compression and the Greedy Method 601\\n13.4 Text Compression and the Greedy Method\\nIn this section, we consider an important text-processing task, text compression .\\nIn this problem, we are given a string Xdeﬁned over some alphabet, such as the\\nASCII or Unicode character sets, and we want to efﬁciently encode Xinto a small\\nbinary string Y(using only the characters 0 and 1). Text compression is useful in\\nany situation where we wish to reduce bandwidth for digital communications, so\\nas to minimize the time needed to transmit our text. Likewise, text compression isuseful for storing large documents more efﬁciently, so as to allow a ﬁxed-capacitystorage device to contain as many documents as possible.\\nThe method for text compression explored in this section is the Huffman code .\\nStandard encoding schemes, such as ASCII, use ﬁxed-length binary strings to en-code characters (with 7 or 8 bits in the traditional or extended ASCII systems,respectively). The Unicode system was originally proposed as a 16-bit ﬁxed-length representation, although common encodings reduce the space usage by al-lowing common groups of characters, such as those from the ASCII system, with\\nfewer bits. The Huffman code saves space over a ﬁxed-length encoding by using\\nshort code-word strings to encode high-frequency characters and long code-wordstrings to encode low-frequency characters. Furthermore, the Huffman code usesa variable-length encoding speciﬁcally optimized for a given string Xover any al-\\nphabet. The optimization is based on the use of character frequencies ,w h e r ew e\\nhave, for each character c, a count f(c)of the number of times cappears in the\\nstring X.\\nTo encode the string X, we convert each character in Xto a variable-length\\ncode-word, and we concatenate all these code-words in order to produce the en-\\ncoding Yfor X. In order to avoid ambiguities, we insist that no code-word in our\\nencoding be a preﬁx of another code-word in our encoding. Such a code is called\\napreﬁx code , and it simpliﬁes the decoding of Yto retrieve X. (See Figure 13.9.)\\nEven with this restriction, the savings produced by a variable-length preﬁx codecan be signiﬁcant, particularly if there is a wide variance in character frequencies\\n(as is the case for natural language text in almost every written language).\\nHuffman’s algorithm for producing an optimal variable-length preﬁx code for\\nXis based on the construction of a binary tree Tthat represents the code. Each\\nedge in Trepresents a bit in a code-word, with an edge to a left child representing\\na “0” and an edge to a right child representing a “1.” Each leaf vis associated\\nwith a speciﬁc character, and the code-word for that character is deﬁned by the\\nsequence of bits associated with the edges in the path from the root of Ttov.( S e e\\nFigure 13.9.) Each leaf vhas a frequency ,f(v), which is simply the frequency in\\nXof the character associated with v. In addition, we give each internal node vinT\\na frequency, f(v), that is the sum of the frequencies of all the leaves in the subtree\\nrooted at v.'),\n",

The algorithm\\nproceeds in a series of rounds. In each round, the algorithm takes the two binarytrees with the smallest frequencies and merges them into a single binary tree. Itrepeats this process until only one tree is left. (See Code Fragment 13.8.)\\nEach iteration of the while loop in Huffman’s algorithm can be implemented\\ninO(logd)time using a priority queue represented with a heap. In addition, each\\niteration takes two nodes out of Qand adds one in, a process that will be repeated\\nd−1 times before exactly one node is left in Q. Thus, this algorithm runs in\\nO(n+dlogd)time. Although a full justiﬁcation of this algorithm’s correctness is\\nbeyond our scope here, we note that its intuition comes from a simple idea—any\\noptimal code can be converted into an optimal code in which the code-words for the\\ntwo lowest-frequency characters, aand b, differ only in their last bit. Repeating the\\nargument for a string with aand breplaced by a character c, gives the following:\\nProposition 13.5:\\nHuffman’s algorithm constructs an optimal preﬁx code for a\\nstring of length nwith ddistinct characters in O(n+dlogd)time.'),\n",

This design pattern is\\napplied to optimization problems, where we are trying to construct some structure\\nwhile minimizing or maximizing some property of that structure.\\nThe general formula for the greedy method pattern is almost as simple as that\\nfor the brute-force method. In order to solve a given optimization problem usingthe greedy method, we proceed by a sequence of choices. The sequence starts\\nfrom some well-understood starting condition, and computes the cost for that ini-tial condition. The pattern then asks that we iteratively make additional choicesby identifying the decision that achieves the best cost improvement from all ofthe choices that are currently possible. This approach does not always lead to an\\noptimal solution.\\nBut there are several problems that it does work for, and such problems are said\\nto possess the greedy-choice property. This is the property that a global optimal\\ncondition can be reached by a series of locally optimal choices (that is, choices\\nthat are each the current best from among the possibilities available at the time),starting from a well-deﬁned starting condition. The problem of computing an opti-mal variable-length preﬁx code is just one example of a problem that possesses the\\ngreedy-choice property.'),\n",

Text Processing\\n13.5 Tries\\nThe pattern-matching algorithms presented in Section 13.2 speed up the search in\\na text by preprocessing the pattern (to compute the failure function in the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm or the last function in the Boyer-Moore algorithm). In thissection, we take a complementary approach, namely, we present string searchingalgorithms that preprocess the text. This approach is suitable for applications where\\na series of queries is performed on a ﬁxed text, so that the initial cost of preprocess-\\ning the text is compensated by a speedup in each subsequent query (for example, aWeb site that offers pattern matching in Shakespeare’s Hamlet or a search engine\\nthat offers Web pages on the Hamlet topic).\\nAtrie(pronounced “try”) is a tree-based data structure for storing strings in\\norder to support fast pattern matching. The main application for tries is in infor-mation retrieval. Indeed, the name “trie” comes from the word “re trieval.” In an\\ninformation retrieval application, such as a search for a certain DNA sequence in agenomic database, we are given a collection Sof strings, all deﬁned using the same\\nalphabet. The primary query operations that tries support are pattern matching andpreﬁx matching . The latter operation involves being given a string X, and looking\\nfor all the strings in Sthat contain Xas a preﬁx.\\n13.5.1 Standard Tries\\nLet Sbe a set of sstrings from alphabet Σsuch that no string in Sis a preﬁx\\nof another string. A standard trie for Sis an ordered tree Twith the following\\nproperties (see Figure 13.10):\\n•Each node of T, except the root, is labeled with a character of Σ.\\n•The children of an internal node of Thave distinct labels.\\n•Thas sleaves, each associated with a string of S, such that the concatenation\\nof the labels of the nodes on the path from the root to a leaf vofTyields the\\nstring of Sassociated with v.\\nThus, a trie Trepresents the strings of Swith paths from the root to the leaves\\nofT. Note the importance of assuming that no string in Sis a preﬁx of another\\nstring. This ensures that each string of Sis uniquely associated with a leaf of T.\\n(This is similar to the restriction for preﬁx codes with Huffman coding, as describedin Section 13.4.) We can always satisfy this assumption by adding a special char-\\nacter that is not in the original alphabet Σat the end of each string.\\nAn internal node in a standard trie Tcan have anywhere between 1 and |Σ|\\nchildren. There is an edge going from the root rto one of its children for each\\ncharacter that is ﬁrst in some string in the collection S. In addition, a path from the\\nroot of Tto an internal node vat depth kcorresponds to a k-character preﬁx X[0:k]'),\n",

In fact, for each character cthat can follow the preﬁx X[0:k]in\\na string of the set S, there is a child of vlabeled with character c. In this way, a trie\\nconcisely stores the common preﬁxes that exist among a set of strings.\\nAs a special case, if there are only two characters in the alphabet, then the\\ntrie is essentially a binary tree, with some internal nodes possibly having only one\\nchild (that is, it may be an improper binary tree). In general, although it is possiblethat an internal node has up to |Σ|children, in practice the average degree of such\\nnodes is likely to be much smaller. For example, the trie shown in Figure 13.10 has\\nseveral internal nodes with only one child. On larger data sets, the average degree\\nof nodes is likely to get smaller at greater depths of the tree, because there maybe fewer strings sharing the common preﬁx, and thus fewer continuations of thatpattern. Furthermore, in many languages, there will be character combinations that\\nare unlikely to naturally occur.\\nThe following proposition provides some important structural properties of a\\nstandard trie:\\nProposition 13.6:\\nA standard trie storing a collection Sofsstrings of total length\\nnfrom an alphabet Σhas the following properties:\\n•The height of Tis equal to the length of the longest string in S.\\n•Every internal node of Thas at most |Σ|children.\\n•Thas sleaves\\n•The number of nodes of Tis at most n+1.\\nThe worst case for the number of nodes of a trie occurs when no two strings\\nshare a common nonempty preﬁx; that is, except for the root, all internal nodes\\nhave one child.'),\n",

Text Processing\\nA trie Tfor a set Sof strings can be used to implement a set or map whose keys\\nare the strings of S. Namely, we perform a search in Tfor a string Xby tracing\\ndown from the root the path indicated by the characters in X. If this path can be\\ntraced and terminates at a leaf node, then we know Xis a key in the map. For\\nexample, in the trie in Figure 13.10, tracing the path for “bull” ends up at a leaf.\\nIf the path cannot be traced or the path can be traced but terminates at an internal\\nnode, then Xis not a key in the map. In the example in Figure 13.10, the path for\\n“bet” cannot be traced and the path for “be” ends at an internal node. Neither such\\nword is in the map.\\nIt is easy to see that the running time of the search for a string of length mis\\nO(m·|Σ|), because we visit at most m+1 nodes of Tand we spend O(|Σ|)time\\nat each node determining the child having the subsequent character as a label. The\\nO(|Σ|)upper bound on the time to locate a child with a given label is achievable,\\neven if the children of a node are unordered, since there are at most |Σ|children.\\nWe can improve the time spent at a node to be O(log|Σ|)or expected O(1),b y\\nmapping characters to children using a secondary search table or hash table at each\\nnode, or by using a direct lookup table of size |Σ|at each node, if |Σ|is sufﬁciently\\nsmall (as is the case for DNA strings). For these reasons, we typically expect a\\nsearch for a string of length mto run in O(m)time.\\nFrom the discussion above, it follows that we can use a trie to perform a spe-\\ncial type of pattern matching, called word matching , where we want to determine\\nwhether a given pattern matches one of the words of the text exactly. Word match-\\ning differs from standard pattern matching because the pattern cannot match anarbitrary substring of the text—only one of its words. To accomplish this, each\\nword of the original document must be added to the trie. (See Figure 13.11.) A\\nsimple extension of this scheme supports preﬁx-matching queries. However, ar-bitrary occurrences of the pattern in the text (for example, the pattern is a propersufﬁx of a word or spans two words) cannot be efﬁciently performed.\\nTo construct a standard trie for a set Sof strings, we can use an incremental\\nalgorithm that inserts the strings one at a time. Recall the assumption that no stringofSis\\na preﬁx of another string. To insert a string Xinto the current trie T,w e\\ntrace the path associated with XinT, creating a new chain of nodes to store the\\nremaining characters of Xwhen we get stuck. The running time to insert Xwith\\nlength mis similar to a search, with worst-case O(m·|Σ|)performance, or expected\\nO(m)if using secondary hash tables at each node. Thus, constructing the entire trie\\nfor set Stakes expected O(n)time, where nis the total length of the strings of S.\\nThere is a potential space inefﬁciency in the standard trie that has prompted the\\ndevelopment of the compressed trie , which is also known (for historical reasons)\\nas the Patricia trie .

The advantage ofa compressed trie over a standard trie is that the number of nodes of the compressedtrie is proportional to the number of strings and not to their total length, as shownin the following proposition (compare with Proposition 13.6).\\nProposition 13.7:\\nA compressed trie storing a collection Sofsstrings from an\\nalphabet of size dhas the following properties:\\n•Every internal node of Thas at least two children and most dchildren.\\n•Thas sleaves nodes.\\n•The number of nodes of TisO(s).'),\n",

Such a trie is called the sufﬁx trie (also\\nknown as a sufﬁx tree orposition tree ) of string X. For example, Figure 13.14a\\nshows the sufﬁx trie for the eight sufﬁxes of string “minimize.” For a sufﬁx trie, the\\ncompact representation presented in the previous section can be further simpliﬁed.\\nNamely, the label of each vertex is a pair (j,k)indicating the string X[j:k].( S e e\\nFigure 13.14b.) To satisfy the rule that no sufﬁx of Xis a preﬁx of another sufﬁx,\\nwe can add a special character, denoted with $, that is not in the original alphabet Σ\\nat the end of X(and thus to every sufﬁx). That is, if string Xhas length n, we build\\na trie for the set of nstrings X[j:n],f o r j=0,..., n−1.\\nSaving Space\\nUsing a sufﬁx trie allows us to save space over a standard trie by using several spacecompression techniques, including those used for the compressed trie.\\nThe advantage of the compact representation of tries now becomes apparent for\\nsufﬁx tries. Since the total length of the sufﬁxes of a string Xof length nis\\n1+2+···+n=n(n+1)\\n2,\\nstoring all the sufﬁxes of Xexplicitly would take O(n2)space. Even so, the suf-\\nﬁx trie represents these strings implicitly in O(n)space, as formally stated in the\\nfollowing proposition.\\nProposition 13.8: The compact representation of a sufﬁx trie Tfor a string Xof\\nlength nuses O(n)space.\\nConstruction\\nWe can construct the sufﬁx trie for a string of length nwith an incremental algo-\\nrithm like the one given in Section 13.5.1. This construction takes O(|Σ|n2)time\\nbecause the total length of the sufﬁxes is quadratic in n. However, the (compact)\\nsufﬁx trie for a string of length ncan be constructed in O(n)time with a specialized\\nalgorithm, different from the one for general tries. This linear-time construction\\nalgorithm is fairly complex, however, and is not reported here. Still, we can takeadvantage of the existence of this fast construction algorithm when we want to use\\na sufﬁx trie to solve other problems.'),\n",

A compressed trie for the set of index terms, where each leaf stores the index\\nof the occurrence list of the associated term.\\nThe reason for storing the occurrence lists outside the trie is to keep the size of the\\ntrie data structure sufﬁciently small to ﬁt in internal memory. Instead, because oftheir large total size, the occurrence lists have to be stored on disk.\\nWith our data structure, a query for a single keyword is similar to a word-\\nmatching query (Section 13.5.1). Namely, we ﬁnd the keyword in the trie and wereturn the associated occurrence list.\\nWhen multiple keywords are given and the desired output are the pages con-\\ntaining allthe given keywords, we retrieve the occurrence list of each keyword\\nusing the trie and return their intersection. To facilitate the intersection computa-tion, each occurrence list should be implemented with a sequence sorted by addressor with a map, to allow efﬁcient set operations.\\nIn addition to the basic task of returning a list of pages containing given key-\\nwords, search engines provide an important additional service by ranking the pages\\nreturned by relevance. Devising fast and accurate ranking algorithms for search\\nengines is a major challenge for computer researchers and electronic commerce\\ncompanies.'),\n",

Graph Algorithms\\n14.1 Graphs\\nAgraph is a way of representing relationships that exist between pairs of objects.\\nThat is, a graph is a set of objects, called vertices, together with a collection of\\npairwise connections between them, called edges. Graphs have applications in\\nmodeling many domains, including mapping, transportation, computer networks,\\nand electrical engineering. By the way, this notion of a “graph” should not beconfused with bar charts and function plots, as these kinds of “graphs” are unrelatedto the topic of this chapter.\\nViewed abstractly, a graph Gis simply a set Vofvertices and a collection E\\nof pairs of vertices from V, called edges . Thus, a graph is a way of representing\\nconnections or relationships between pairs of objects from some set V. Incidentally,\\nsome books use different terminology for graphs and refer to what we call verticesasnodes and what we call edges as arcs. We use the terms “vertices” and “edges.”\\nEdges in a graph are either directed orundirected . An edge (u,v)is said to\\nbedirected from utovif the pair (u,v)is ordered, with upreceding v. An edge\\n(u,v)i ss a i dt ob e undirected if the pair (u,v)is not ordered. Undirected edges are\\nsometimes denoted with set notation, as {u,v}, but for simplicity we use the pair\\nnotation (u,v), noting that in the undirected case (u,v)is the same as (v,u). Graphs\\nare typically visualized by drawing the vertices as ovals or rectangles and the edgesas segments or curves connecting pairs of ovals and rectangles. The following aresome examples of directed and undirected graphs.\\nExample 14.1:\\nWe can visualize collaborations among the researchers of a cer-\\ntain discipline by constructing a graph whose vertices are associated with the re-\\nsearchers themselves, and whose edges connect pairs of vertices associated with\\nresearchers who have coauthored a paper or book. (See Figure 14.1.) Such edges\\nare undirected because coauthorship is a symmetric relation; that is, if Ahas coau-\\nthored something with B,t h e n Bnecessarily has coauthored something with A.\\nChiangGoldwasser\\nTamassia GoodrichGarg Snoeyink\\nTollis\\nVitter Preparata\\nFigure 14.1: Graph of coauthorship among some authors.'),\n",

Graphs 621\\nExample 14.2: We can associate with an object-oriented program a graph whose\\nvertices represent the classes deﬁned in the program, and whose edges indicate\\ninheritance between classes. There is an edge from a vertex vto a vertex uif\\nthe class for vinherits from the class for u. Such edges are directed because the\\ninheritance relation only goes in one direction (that is, it is asymmetric ).\\nIf all the edges in a graph are undirected, then we say the graph is an undirected\\ngraph . Likewise, a directed graph , also called a digraph , is a graph whose edges\\nare all directed. A graph that has both directed and undirected edges is often called\\namixed graph . Note that an undirected or mixed graph can be converted into a\\ndirected graph by replacing every undirected edge (u,v)by the pair of directed\\nedges (u,v)and (v,u). It is often useful, however, to keep undirected and mixed\\ngraphs represented as they are, for such graphs have several applications, as in thefollowing example.\\nExample 14.3:\\nA city map can be modeled as a graph whose vertices are intersec-\\ntions or dead ends, and whose edges are stretches of streets without intersections.\\nThis graph has both undirected edges, which correspond to stretches of two-way\\nstreets, and directed edges, which correspond to stretches of one-way streets. Thus,\\nin this way, a graph modeling a city map is a mixed graph.\\nExample 14.4: Physical examples of graphs are present in the electrical wiring\\nand plumbing networks of a building. Such networks can be modeled as graphs,\\nwhere each connector, ﬁxture, or outlet is viewed as a vertex, and each uninter-\\nrupted stretch of wire or pipe is viewed as an edge. Such graphs are actually com-\\nponents of much larger graphs, namely the local power and water distribution net-\\nworks. Depending on the speciﬁc aspects of these graphs that we are interested in,\\nwe may consider their edges as undirected or directed, for, in principle, water can\\nﬂow in a pipe and current can ﬂow in a wire in either direction.\\nThe two vertices joined by an edge are called the end vertices (orendpoints )\\nof the edge. If an edge is directed, its ﬁrst endpoint is its origin and the other is the\\ndestination of the edge. Two vertices uand vare said to be adjacent if there is an\\nedge whose end vertices are uand v. A ne d g ei ss a i dt ob e incident to a vertex if\\nthe vertex is one of the edge’s endpoints. The outgoing edges of a vertex are the\\ndirected edges whose origin is that vertex. The incoming edges of a vertex are the\\ndirected edges whose destination is that vertex. The degree of a vertex v, denoted\\ndeg (v), is the number of incident edges of v.T h e in-degree andout-degree of a\\nvertex vare the number of the incoming and outgoing edges of v, and are denoted\\nindeg (v)and outdeg (v), respectively.'),\n",

Graph Algorithms\\nExample 14.5: We can study air transportation by constructing a graph G, called\\naﬂight network , whose vertices are associated with airports, and whose edges\\nare associated with ﬂights. (See Figure 14.2.) In graph G, the edges are directed\\nbecause a given ﬂight has a speciﬁc travel direction. The endpoints of an edge ein\\nGcorrespond respectively to the origin and destination of the ﬂight corresponding\\ntoe. Two airports are adjacent in Gif there is a ﬂight that ﬂies between them,\\nand an edge eis incident to a vertex vinGif the ﬂight for eﬂies to or from the\\nairport for v. The outgoing edges of a vertex vcorrespond to the outbound ﬂights\\nfrom v’s airport, and the incoming edges correspond to the inbound ﬂights to v’s\\nairport. Finally, the in-degree of a vertex vofGcorresponds to the number of\\ninbound ﬂights to v’s airport, and the out-degree of a vertex vinGcorresponds to\\nthe number of outbound ﬂights.\\nORD\\nMIANW 35\\nAA 903DL 247DL 335\\nAA 49\\nAA 411AA 523UA 120UA 877SW 45\\nAA 1387\\nDFW\\nLAXSFOBOS\\nJFK\\nFigure 14.2: Example of a directed graph representing a ﬂight network. The end-\\npoints of edge UA 120 are LAX and ORD; hence, LAX and ORD are adjacent.\\nThe in-degree of DFW is 3, and the out-degree of DFW is 2.\\nThe deﬁnition of a graph refers to the group of edges as a collection , not a\\nset, thus allowing two undirected edges to have the same end vertices, and for two\\ndirected edges to have the same origin and the same destination. Such edges arecalled parallel edges ormultiple edges . A ﬂight network can contain parallel edges\\n(Example 14.5), such that multiple edges between the same pair of vertices couldindicate different ﬂights operating on the same route at different times of the day.Another special type of edge is one that connects a vertex to itself. Namely, we say\\nthat an edge (undirected or directed) is a self-loop if its two endpoints coincide. A\\nself-loop may occur in a graph associated with a city map (Example 14.3), where\\nit would correspond to a “circle” (a curving street that returns to its starting point).\\nWith few exceptions, graphs do not have parallel edges or self-loops. Such\\ngraphs are said to be simple . Thus, we can usually say that the edges of a simple\\ngraph are a setof vertex pairs (and not just a collection). Throughout this chapter,\\nwe assume that a graph is simple unless otherwise speciﬁed.'),\n",

Graphs 623\\nApath is a sequence of alternating vertices and edges that starts at a vertex and\\nends at a vertex such that each edge is incident to its predecessor and successor\\nvertex. A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex, and that includes at\\nleast one edge. We say that a path is simple if each vertex in the path is distinct, and\\nwe say that a cycle is simple if each vertex in the cycle is distinct, except for the\\nﬁrst and last one. A directed path is a path such that all edges are directed and are\\ntraversed along their direction. A directed cycle is similarly deﬁned. For example,\\nin Figure 14.2, (BOS, NW 35, JFK, AA 1387, DFW) is a directed simple path, and(LAX, UA 120, ORD, UA 877, DFW, AA 49, LAX) is a directed simple cycle.Note that a directed graph may have a cycle consisting of two edges with opposite\\ndirection between the same pair of vertices, for example (ORD, UA 877, DFW,\\nDL 335, ORD) in Figure 14.2. A directed graph is acyclic if it has no directed\\ncycles. For example, if we were to remove the edge UA 877 from the graph inFigure 14.2, the remaining graph is acyclic. If a graph is simple, we may omit theedges when describing path Por cycle C, as these are well deﬁned, in which case\\nPis a list of adjacent vertices and Cis a cycle of adjacent vertices.\\nExample 14.6:\\nGiven a graph Grepresenting a city map (see Example 14.3), we\\ncan model a couple driving to dinner at a recommended restaurant as traversing a\\npath though G.

Data Structures for Graphs 627\\n14.2 Data Structures for Graphs\\nIn this section, we introduce four data structures for representing a graph. In each\\nrepresentation, we maintain a collection to store the vertices of a graph. However,\\nthe four representations differ greatly in the way they organize the edges.\\n•In an edge list , we maintain an unordered list of all edges. This minimally\\nsufﬁces, but there is no efﬁcient way to locate a particular edge (u,v),o rt h e\\nset of all edges incident to a vertex v.\\n•In an adjacency list , we maintain, for each vertex, a separate list containing\\nthose edges that are incident to the vertex. The complete set of edges can\\nbe determined by taking the union of the smaller sets, while the organizationallows us to more efﬁciently ﬁnd all edges incident to a given vertex.\\n•Anadjacency map is very similar to an adjacency list, but the secondary\\ncontainer of all edges incident to a vertex is organized as a map, rather thanas a list, with the adjacent vertex serving as a key. This allows for access toa speciﬁc edge (u,v)inO(1)expected time.\\n•Anadjacency matrix provides worst-case O(1)access to a speciﬁc edge\\n(u,v)by maintaining an n×nmatrix, for a graph with nvertices. Each\\nentry is dedicated to storing a reference to the edge (u,v)for a particular pair\\nof vertices uand v; if no such edge exists, the entry will be None .\\nA summary of the performance of these structures is given in Table 14.1.

We begin by discussing the space usage, which is O(n+m)for\\nrepresenting a graph with nvertices and medges. Each individual vertex or edge\\ninstance uses O(1)space, and the additional lists Vand Euse space proportional\\nto their number of entries.\\nIn terms of running time, the edge list structure does as well as one could hope\\nin terms of reporting the number of vertices or edges, or in producing an iteration\\nof those vertices or edges. By querying the respective list VorE,t h evertex\\n count\\nandedge\\ncount methods run in O(1)time, and by iterating through the appropriate\\nlist, the methods vertices andedges run respectively in O(n)and O(m)time.\\nThe most signiﬁcant limitations of an edge list structure, especially when com-\\npared to the other graph representations, are the O(m)running times of methods\\nget\\nedge(u,v) ,degree(v) ,a n d incident\\n edges(v) . The problem is that with all\\nedges of the graph in an unordered list E, the only way to answer those queries\\nis through an exhaustive inspection of all edges. The other data structures intro-\\nduced in this section will implement these methods more efﬁciently.\\nFinally, we consider the methods that update the graph. It is easy to add a new\\nvertex or a new edge to the graph in O(1)time. For example, a new edge can be\\nadded to the graph by creating an Edge instance storing the given element as data,\\nadding that instance to the positional list E, and recording its resulting Position\\nwithin Eas an attribute of the edge. That stored position can later be used to\\nlocate and remove this edge from EinO(1)time, and thus implement the method\\nremove\\n edge(e)\\nIt is worth discussing why the remove\\n vertex(v) method has a running time of\\nO(m). As stated in the graph ADT, when a vertex vis removed from the graph, all\\nedges incident to vmust also be removed (otherwise, we would have a contradiction\\nof edges that refer to vertices that are not part of the graph).

Graph Algorithms\\n14.2.2 Adjacency List Structure\\nIn contrast to the edge list representation of a graph, the adjacency list structure\\ngroups the edges of a graph by storing them in smaller, secondary containers that\\nare associated with each individual vertex. Speciﬁcally, for each vertex v,w em a i n -\\ntain a collection I(v), called the incidence collection ofv, whose entries are edges\\nincident to v. (In the case of a directed graph, outgoing and incoming edges can be\\nrespectively stored in two separate collections, Iout(v)and Iin(v).) Traditionally, the\\nincidence collection I(v)for a vertex vis a list, which is why we call this way of\\nrepresenting a graph the adjacency list structure.\\nWe require that the primary structure for an adjacency list maintain the col-\\nlection Vof vertices in a way so that we can locate the secondary structure I(v)\\nfor a given vertex vinO(1)time. This could be done by using a positional list\\nto represent V, with each Vertex instance maintaining a direct reference to its I(v)\\nincidence collection; we illustrate such an adjacency list structure of a graph in Fig-\\nure 14.5. If vertices can be uniquely numbered from 0 to n−1, we could instead\\nuse a primary array-based structure to access the appropriate secondary lists.\\nThe primary beneﬁt of an adjacency list is that the collection I(v)contains ex-\\nactly those edges that should be reported by the method incident\\n edges(v) .T h e r e -\\nfore, we can implement this method by iterating the edges of I(v)inO(deg (v))\\ntime, where deg (v)is the degree of vertex v.

The primary list of vertices uses O(n)space. The sum of the lengths of\\nall secondary lists is O(m), for reasons that were formalized in Propositions 14.8\\nand 14.9. In short, an undirected edge (u,v)is referenced in both I(u)and I(v),b u t\\nits presence in the graph results in only a constant amount of additional space.\\nWe have already noted that the incident\\n edges(v) method can be achieved in\\nO(deg (v))time based on use of I(v). We can achieve the degree(v) method of\\nthe graph ADT to use O(1)time, assuming collection I(v)can report its size in\\nsimilar time. To locate a speciﬁc edge for implementing get\\nedge(u,v) , we can\\nsearch through either I(u)and I(v). By choosing the smaller of the two, we get\\nO(min (deg (u),deg (v)))running time.\\nThe rest of the bounds in Table 14.3 can be achieved with additional care. To\\nefﬁciently support deletions of edges, an edge (u,v)would need to maintain a ref-\\nerence to its positions within both I(u)and I(v), so that it could be deleted from\\nthose collections in O(1)time. To remove a vertex v, we must also remove any\\nincident edges, but at least we can locate those edges in O(deg (v))time.\\nThe easiest way to support edges() inO(m)andcount\\n edges() inO(1)is to\\nmaintain an auxiliary list Eof edges, as in the edge list representation. Otherwise,\\nwe can implement the edges method in O(n+m)time by accessing each secondary\\nlist and reporting its edges, taking care not to report an undirected edge (u,v)twice.\\nOperation\\n Running Time\\nvertex\\n count(), edge\\n count()\\n O(1)\\nvertices()\\n O(n)\\nedges()\\n O(m)\\nget\\nedge(u,v)\\n O(min (deg (u),deg (v)))\\ndegree(v)\\n O(1)\\nincident\\n edges(v)\\n O(deg (v))\\ninsert\\n vertex(x), insert\\n edge(u,v,x)\\n O(1)\\nremove\\n edge(e)\\n O(1)\\nremove\\n vertex(v)\\n O(deg (v))\\nTable 14.3: Running times of the methods of a graph implemented with the adja-\\ncency list structure.

Graph Algorithms\\n14.2.3 Adjacency Map Structure\\nIn the adjacency list structure, we assume that the secondary incidence collections\\nare implemented as unordered linked lists. Such a collection I(v)uses space pro-\\nportional to O(deg (v)), allows an edge to be added or removed in O(1)time, and\\nallows an iteration of all edges incident to vertex vinO(deg (v))time. However,\\nthe best implementation of get\\nedge(u,v) requires O(min (deg (u),deg (v)))time,\\nbecause we must search through either I(u)orI(v).\\nWe can improve the performance by using a hash-based map to implement I(v)\\nfor each vertex v. Speciﬁcally, we let the opposite endpoint of each incident edge\\nserve as a key in the map, with the edge structure serving as the value. We call such\\na graph representation an adjacency map . (See Figure 14.6.) The space usage for\\nan adjacency map remains O(n+m), because I(v)uses O(deg (v))space for each\\nvertex v, as with the adjacency list.\\nThe advantage of the adjacency map, relative to an adjacency list, is that the\\nget\\nedge(u,v) method can be implemented in expected O(1)time by searching for\\nvertex uas a key in I(v), or vice versa. This provides a likely improvement over the\\nadjacency list, while retaining the worst-case bound of O(min (deg (u),deg (v))).\\nIn comparing the performance of adjacency map to other representations (see\\nTable 14.1), we ﬁnd that it essentially achieves optimal running times for all meth-\\nods, making it an excellent all-purpose choice as a graph representation.\\nhe g\\nvu\\nwzf gh\\nw\\nhuuw v\\ng e\\nf ew\\nvuz\\nfv\\nw\\nzV\\n(a) (b)\\nFigure 14.6: (a) An undirected graph G; (b) a schematic representation of the ad-\\njacency map structure for G.

Data Structures for Graphs 633\\n14.2.4 Adjacency Matrix Structure\\nTheadjacency matrix structure for a graph Gaugments the edge list structure with\\na matrix A(that is, a two-dimensional array, as in Section 5.6), which allows us to\\nlocate an edge between a given pair of vertices in worst-case constant time. In the\\nadjacency matrix representation, we think of the vertices as being the integers in\\nthe set {0,1,..., n−1}and the edges as being pairs of such integers. This allows\\nus to store references to edges in the cells of a two-dimensional n×narray A.\\nSpeciﬁcally, the cell A[i,j]holds a reference to the edge (u,v), if it exists, where u\\nis the vertex with index iand vis the vertex with index j. If there is no such edge,\\nthen A[i,j]=None . We note that array Ais symmetric if graph Gis undirected, as\\nA[i,j]= A[j,i]for all pairs iand j. (See Figure 14.7.)\\nThe most signiﬁcant advantage of an adjacency matrix is that any edge (u,v)\\ncan be accessed in worst-case O(1)time; recall that the adjacency map supports\\nthat operation in O(1)expected time. However, several operation are less efﬁcient\\nwith an adjacency matrix. For example, to ﬁnd the edges incident to vertex v,w e\\nmust presumably examine all nentries in the row associated with v; recall that an\\nadjacency list or map can locate those edges in optimal O(deg (v))time. Adding or\\nremoving vertices from a graph is problematic, as the matrix must be resized.\\nFurthermore, the O(n2)space usage of an adjacency matrix is typically far\\nworse than the O(n+m)space required of the other representations. Although,\\nin the worst case, the number of edges in a dense graph will be proportional to\\nn2, most real-world graphs are sparse . In such cases, use of an adjacency matrix\\nis inefﬁcient. However, if a graph is dense, the constants of proportionality of an\\nadjacency matrix can be smaller than that of an adjacency list or map. In fact, ifedges do not have auxiliary data, a Boolean adjacency matrix can use one bit peredge slot, such that A[i,j]=True if and only if associated (u,v)is an edge.\\nhe g\\nvu\\nwzf h0\\n1\\n2\\n30123\\nu\\nv\\nw\\nze\\neg\\ngf\\nfh\\n(a) (b)\\nFigure 14.7: (a) An undirected graph G; (b) a schematic representation of the aux-\\niliary adjacency matrix structure for G,i nw h i c h nvertices are mapped to indices 0\\nton−1.

Graph Algorithms\\n14.2.5 Python Implementation\\nIn this section, we provide an implementation of the Graph ADT. Our implementa-\\ntion will support directed or undirected graphs, but for ease of explanation, we ﬁrstdescribe it in the context of an undirected graph.\\nWe use a variant of the adjacency map representation. For each vertex v,w e\\nuse a Python dictionary to represent the secondary incidence map I(v).H o w e v e r ,\\nwe do not explicitly maintain lists Vand E, as originally described in the edge list\\nrepresentation. The list Vis replaced by a top-level dictionary Dthat maps each\\nvertex vto its incidence map I(v); note that we can iterate through all vertices by\\ngenerating the set of keys for dictionary D. By using such a dictionary Dto map\\nvertices to the secondary incidence maps, we need not maintain references to thoseincidence maps as part of the vertex structures. Also, a vertex does not need toexplicitly maintain a reference to its position in D, because it can be determined\\ninO(1)expected time. This greatly simpliﬁes our implementation. However, a\\nconsequence of our design is that some of the worst-case running time bounds forthe graph ADT operations, given in Table 14.1, become expected bounds. Rather\\nthan maintain list E, we are content with taking the union of the edges found in the\\nvarious incidence maps; technically, this runs in O(n+m)time rather than strictly\\nO(m)time, as the dictionary Dhas nkeys, even if some incidence maps are empty.\\nOur implementation of the graph ADT is given in Code Fragments 14.1 through\\n14.3. Classes Vertex andEdge , given in Code Fragment 14.1, are rather simple,\\nand can be nested within the more complex Graph class. Note that we deﬁne the\\nhash\\n method for both Vertex andEdge so that those instances can be used as\\nkeys in Python’s hash-based sets and dictionaries. The rest of the Graph class is\\ngiven in Code Fragments 14.2 and 14.3. Graphs are undirected by default, but canbe declared as directed with an optional parameter to the constructor.\\nInternally, we manage the directed case by having two different top-level dictio-\\nnary instances,\\noutgoing and\\nincoming , such that\\n outgoing[v] maps to another\\ndictionary representing Iout(v),a n d\\n incoming[v] maps to a representation of Iin(v).\\nIn order to unify our treatment of directed and undirected graphs, we continue touse the\\noutgoing and\\nincoming identiﬁers in the undirected case, yet as aliases\\nto the same dictionary. For convenience, we deﬁne a utility named is\\ndirected to\\nallow us to distinguish between the two cases.\\nFor methods degree andincident\\n edges , which each accept an optional param-\\neter to differentiate between the outgoing and incoming orientations, we choose theappropriate map before proceeding. For method insert\\nvertex , we always initial-\\nize\\noutgoing[v] to an empty dictionary for new vertex v. In the directed case, we\\nindependently initialize\\n incoming[v] as well.

Graph Traversals 639\\n14.3.1 Depth-First Search\\nThe ﬁrst traversal algorithm we consider in this section is depth-ﬁrst search (DFS).\\nDepth-ﬁrst search is useful for testing a number of properties of graphs, including\\nwhether there is a path from one vertex to another and whether or not a graph is\\nconnected.\\nDepth-ﬁrst search in a graph Gis analogous to wandering in a labyrinth with\\na string and a can of paint without getting lost. We begin at a speciﬁc startingvertex sinG, which we initialize by ﬁxing one end of our string to sand painting\\nsas “visited.” The vertex sis now our “current” vertex—call our current vertex u.\\nWe then traverse Gby considering an (arbitrary) edge (u,v)incident to the current\\nvertex u. If the edge (u,v)leads us to a vertex vthat is already visited (that is,\\npainted), we ignore that edge. If, on the other hand, (u,v)leads to an unvisited\\nvertex v, then we unroll our string, and go to v. We then paint vas “visited,” and\\nmake it the current vertex, repeating the computation above. Eventually, we will getto a “dead end,” that is, a current vertex vsuch that all the edges incident to vlead\\nto vertices already visited. To get out of this impasse, we roll our string back up,backtracking along the edge that brought us to v, going back to a previously visited\\nvertex u.W et h e nm a k e uour current vertex and repeat the computation above for\\nany edges incident to uthat we have not yet considered. If all of u’s incident edges\\nlead to visited vertices, then we again roll up our string and backtrack to the vertexwe came from to get to u, and repeat the procedure at that vertex. Thus, we continue\\nto backtrack along the path that we have traced so far until we ﬁnd a vertex that has\\nyet unexplored edges, take one such edge, and continue the traversal. The process\\nterminates when our backtracking leads us back to the start vertex s, and there are\\nno more unexplored edges incident to s.\\nThe pseudo-code for a depth-ﬁrst search traversal starting at a vertex u(see\\nCode Fragment 14.4) follows our analogy with string and paint. We use recursion\\nto implement the string analogy, and we assume that we have a mechanism (the\\npaint analogy) to determine whether a vertex or edge has been previously explored.\\nAlgorithm DFS(G,u) : {We assume uhas already been marked as visited }\\nInput: Ag r a p h Gand\\na vertex uofG\\nOutput: A collection of vertices reachable from u, with their discovery edges\\nforeach outgoing edge e=(u,v)ofudo\\nifvertex vhas not been visited then\\nMark vertex vas visited (via edge e).\\nRecursively call DFS(G,v) .\\nCode Fragment 14.4: TheDFS algorithm.'),\n",

Graph Algorithms\\nClassifying Graph Edges with DFS\\nAn execution of depth-ﬁrst search can be used to analyze the structure of a graph,\\nbased upon the way in which edges are explored during the traversal. The DFSprocess naturally identiﬁes what is known as the depth-ﬁrst search tree rooted at\\na starting vertex s. Whenever an edge e=(u,v)is used to discover a new vertex v\\nduring the DFS algorithm of Code Fragment 14.4, that edge is known as a discovery\\nedge ortree edge , as oriented from utov. All other edges that are considered during\\nthe execution of DFS are known as nontree edges , which take us to a previously\\nvisited vertex. In the case of an undirected graph, we will ﬁnd that all nontree edges\\nthat are explored connect the current vertex to one that is an ancestor of it in the\\nDFS tree. We will call such an edge a back edge . When performing a DFS on a\\ndirected graph, there are three possible kinds of nontree edges:\\n•back edges , which connect a vertex to an ancestor in the DFS tree\\n•forward edges , which connect a vertex to a descendant in the DFS tree\\n•cross edges , which connect a vertex to a vertex that is neither its ancestor nor\\nits descendant.\\nAn example application of the DFS algorithm on a directed graph is shown in\\nFigure 14.8, demonstrating each type of nontree edge.

Graph Algorithms\\nProperties of a Depth-First Search\\nThere are a number of observations that we can make about the depth-ﬁrst search\\nalgorithm, many of which derive from the way the DFS algorithm partitions the\\nedges of a graph Ginto groups. We begin with the most signiﬁcant property.\\nProposition 14.12: Let Gbe an undirected graph on which a DFS traversal start-\\ning at a vertex shas been performed. Then the traversal visits all vertices in the\\nconnected component of s, and the discovery edges form a spanning tree of the\\nconnected component of s.\\nJustiﬁcation: Suppose there is at least one vertex wins’s connected component\\nnot visited, and let vbe the ﬁrst unvisited vertex on some path from stow(we may\\nhave v=w). Since vis the ﬁrst unvisited vertex on this path, it has a neighbor u\\nthat was visited. But when we visited u, we must have considered the edge (u,v);\\nhence, it cannot be correct that vis unvisited. Therefore, there are no unvisited\\nvertices in s’s connected component.\\nSince we only follow a discovery edge when we go to an unvisited vertex, we\\nwill never form a cycle with such edges. Therefore, the discovery edges form a\\nconnected subgraph without cycles, hence a tree. Moreover, this is a spanningtree because, as we have just seen, the depth-ﬁrst search visits each vertex in the\\nconnected component of s.\\nProposition 14.13: Let⃗Gbe a directed graph. Depth-ﬁrst search on ⃗Gstarting at\\na vertex svisits all the vertices of ⃗Gthat are reachable from s. Also, the DFS tree\\ncontains directed paths from sto every vertex reachable from s.\\nJustiﬁcation: Let Vsbe the subset of vertices of ⃗Gvisited by DFS starting at\\nvertex s. We want to show that Vscontains sand every vertex reachable from s\\nbelongs to Vs. Suppose now, for the sake of a contradiction, that there is a vertex w\\nreachable from sthat is not in Vs. Consider a directed path from stow,a n dl e t (u,v)\\nbe the ﬁrst edge on such a path taking us out of Vs,t h a ti s , uis in Vsbut vis not\\ninVs. When DFS reaches u, it explores all the outgoing edges of u, and thus must\\nreach also vertex vvia edge (u,v). Hence, vshould be in Vs, and we have obtained\\na contradiction. Therefore, Vsmust contain every vertex reachable from s.\\nWe prove the second fact by induction on the steps of the algorithm. We claim\\nthat each time a discovery edge (u,v)is identiﬁed, there exists a directed path from\\nstovin the DFS tree. Since umust have previously been discovered, there exists\\na path from stou, so by appending the edge (u,v)to that path, we have a directed\\npath from stov.\\nNote that since back edges always connect a vertex vto a previously visited\\nvertex u, each back edge implies a cycle in G, consisting of the discovery edges\\nfrom utovplus the back edge (u,v).'),\n",

Graph Traversals 643\\nRunning Time of Depth-First Search\\nIn terms of its running time, depth-ﬁrst search is an efﬁcient method for traversing\\na graph. Note that DFS is called at most once on each vertex (since it gets marked\\nas visited), and therefore every edge is examined at most twice for an undirected\\ngraph, once from each of its end vertices, and at most once in a directed graph,from its origin vertex. If we let n\\ns≤nbe the number of vertices reachable from\\na vertex s,a n d ms≤mbe the number of incident edges to those vertices, a DFS\\nstarting at sruns in O(ns+ms)time, provided the following conditions are satisﬁed:\\n•The graph is represented by a data structure such that creating and iterating\\nthrough the incident\\n edges(v) takes O(deg (v))time, and the e.opposite(v)\\nmethod takes O(1)time. The adjacency list structure is one such structure,\\nbut the adjacency matrix structure is not.\\n•We have a way to “mark” a vertex or edge as explored, and to test if a vertexor edge has been explored in O(1)time. We discuss ways of implementing\\nDFS to achieve this goal in the next section.\\nGiven the assumptions above, we can solve a number of interesting problems.\\nProposition 14.14:\\nLet Gbe an undirected graph with nvertices and medges.

This parameter should be a Python dictionary that maps a vertex of the\\ngraph to the tree edge that was used to discover that vertex. As a technicality, weassume that the source vertex uoccurs as a key of the dictionary, with None as its\\nvalue. Thus, a caller might start the traversal as follows:\\nresult = {u:None} # a new dictionary, with u trivially discovered\\nDFS(g, u, result)\\nThe dictionary serves two purposes. Internally, the dictionary provides a mecha-nism for recognizing visited vertices, as they will appear as keys in the dictionary.Externally, the DFS function augments this dictionary as it proceeds, and thus the\\nvalues within the dictionary are the DFS tree edges at the conclusion of the process.\\nBecause the dictionary is hash-based, the test, “ ifvnot in discovered ,” and\\nthe record-keeping step, “ discovered[v] = e ,” run in O(1)expected time, rather\\nthan worst-case time. In practice, this is a compromise we are willing to accept,but it does violate the formal analysis of the algorithm, as given on page 643. If wecould assume that vertices could be numbered from 0 to n−1, then those numbers\\ncould be used as indices into an array-based lookup table rather than a hash-basedmap. Alternatively, we could store each vertex’s discovery status and associated\\ntree edge directly as part of the vertex instance.'),\n",

This path can easily be recon-\\nstructed from the information that was recorded in the discovery dictionary during\\nthe traversal. Code Fragment 14.6 provides an implementation of a secondary func-tion that produces an ordered list of vertices on the path from utov.\\nTo reconstruct the path, we begin at the endof the path, examining the discovery\\ndictionary to determine what edge was used to reach vertex v, and then what the\\nother endpoint of that edge is. We add that vertex to a list, and then repeat theprocess to determine what edge was used to discover it. Once we have traced thepath all the way back to the starting vertex u, we can reverse the list so that it is\\nproperly oriented from utov, and return it to the caller. This process takes time\\nproportional to the length of the path, and therefore it runs in O(n)time (in addition\\nto the time originally spent calling DFS).\\n1defconstruct\\npath(u, v, discovered):\\n2path = [ ] # empty path by default\\n3ifvindiscovered:\\n4 # we build list from v to u and then reverse it at the end\\n5 path.append(v)\\n6 walk = v\\n7 while walkis not u:\\n8 e = discovered[walk] # ﬁnd edge leading to walk\\n9 parent = e.opposite(walk)\\n10 path.append(parent)\\n11 walk = parent\\n12 path.reverse( ) # reorient path from u to v\\n13return path\\nCode Fragment 14.6: Function to reconstruct a directed path from utov,g i v e nt h e\\ntrace of discovery from a DFS started at u.

If this ﬁrst\\ndepth-ﬁrst search visits each vertex of ⃗G, we need to then check whether sis reach-\\nable from all other vertices.

A minor modiﬁcation to the core DFS methodcould be used to tag each vertex with a component number when it is discovered.\\n(See Exercise C-14.44.)\\nThe situation is more complex for ﬁnding strongly connected components of\\na directed graph. There exists an approach for computing those components inO(n+m)time, making use of two separate depth-ﬁrst search traversals, but the\\ndetails are beyond the scope of this book.\\nDetecting Cycles with DFS\\nFor both undirected and directed graphs, a cycle exists if and only if a back edge\\nexists relative to the DFS traversal of that graph. It is easy to see that if a back edge\\nexists, a cycle exists by taking the back edge from the descendant to its ancestorand then following the tree edges back to the descendant. Conversely, if a cycleexists in the graph, there must be a back edge relative to a DFS (although we do not\\nprove this fact here).\\nAlgorithmically, detecting a back edge in the undirected case is easy, because\\nall edges are either tree edges or back edges. In the case of a directed graph, ad-ditional modiﬁcations to the core DFS implementation are needed to properly cat-\\negorize a nontree edge as a back edge. When a directed edge is explored leadingto a previously visited vertex, we must recognize whether that vertex is an ancestorof the current vertex. This requires some additional bookkeeping, for example, bytagging vertices upon which a recursive call to DFS is still active. We leave details\\nas an exercise (C-14.43).'),\n",

Graph Algorithms\\n14.3.3 Breadth-First Search\\nThe advancing and backtracking of a depth-ﬁrst search, as described in the previ-\\nous section, deﬁnes a traversal that could be physically traced by a single personexploring a graph. In this section, we consider another algorithm for traversinga connected component of a graph, known as a breadth-ﬁrst search (BFS). The\\nBFS algorithm is more akin to sending out, in all directions, many explorers who\\ncollectively traverse a graph in coordinated fashion.\\nA BFS proceeds in rounds and subdivides the vertices into levels . BFS starts\\nat vertex s, which is at level 0. In the ﬁrst round, we paint as “visited,” all vertices\\nadjacent to the start vertex s—these vertices are one step away from the beginning\\nand are placed into level 1. In the second round, we allow all explorers to go\\ntwo steps (i.e., edges) away from the starting vertex. These new vertices, whichare adjacent to level 1 vertices and not previously assigned to a level, are placed\\ninto level 2 and marked as “visited.” This process continues in similar fashion,\\nterminating when no new vertices are found in a level.\\nA Python implementation of BFS is given in Code Fragment 14.8. We follow\\na convention similar to that of DFS (Code Fragment 14.5), using a discovered dic-\\ntionary both to recognize visited vertices, and to record the discovery edges of theBFS tree.

For BFS on\\nan undirected graph, all nontree edges are cross edges (see Exercise C-14.47), andfor BFS on a directed graph, all nontree edges are either back edges or cross edges\\n(see Exercise C-14.48).\\nThe BFS traversal algorithm has a number of interesting properties, some of\\nwhich we explore in the proposition that follows. Most notably, a path in a breadth-\\nﬁrst search tree rooted at vertex sto any other vertex vis guaranteed to be the\\nshortest such path from stovin terms of the number of edges.\\nProposition 14.16:\\nLet Gbe an undirected or directed graph on which a BFS\\ntraversal starting at vertex shas been performed.

Transitive Closure 651\\n14.4 Transitive Closure\\nWe have seen that graph traversals can be used to answer basic questions of reach-\\nability in a directed graph. In particular, if we are interested in knowing whether\\nthere is a path from vertex uto vertex vin a graph, we can perform a DFS or BFS\\ntraversal starting at uand observe whether vis discovered. If representing a graph\\nwith an adjacency list or adjacency map, we can answer the question of reachability\\nforuand vinO(n+m)time (see Propositions 14.15 and 14.17).\\nIn certain applications, we may wish to answer many reachability queries more\\nefﬁciently, in which case it may be worthwhile to precompute a more convenientrepresentation of a graph. For example, the ﬁrst step for a service that computes\\ndriving directions from an origin to a destination might be to assess whether the\\ndestination is reachable. Similarly, in an electricity network, we may wish to beable to quickly determine whether current ﬂows from one particular vertex to an-other. Motivated by such applications, we introduce the following deﬁnition. The\\ntransitive closure of a directed graph ⃗Gis itself a directed graph ⃗G\\n∗such that the\\nvertices of ⃗G∗are the same as the vertices of ⃗G,a n d⃗G∗has an edge (u,v), when-\\never⃗Ghas a directed path from utov(including the case where (u,v)is an edge of\\nthe original ⃗G).\\nIf a graph is represented as an adjacency list or adjacency map, we can compute\\nits transitive closure in O(n(n+m))time by making use of ngraph traversals, one\\nfrom each starting vertex. For example, a DFS starting at vertex ucan be used to\\ndetermine all vertices reachable from u, and thus a collection of edges originating\\nwith uin the transitive closure.\\nIn the remainder of this section, we explore an alternative technique for comput-\\ning the transitive closure of a directed graph that is particularly well suited for when\\na directed graph is represented by a data structure that supports O(1)-time lookup\\nfor the get\\nedge(u,v) method (for example, the adjacency-matrix structure).

In a generic round k, we construct directed graph ⃗Gkstarting\\nwith⃗Gk=⃗Gk−1and adding to ⃗Gkthe directed edge (vi,vj)if directed graph ⃗Gk−1\\ncontains both the edges (vi,vk)and (vk,vj). In this way, we will enforce a simple\\nrule embodied in the proposition that follows.\\nProposition 14.18: For i=1,..., n, directed graph ⃗Gkhas an edge (vi,vj)if and\\nonly if directed graph ⃗Ghas a directed path from vitovj, whose intermediate\\nvertices (if any) are in the set {v1,..., vk}.

Applications of such graphs include the following:\\n•Prerequisites between courses of a degree program.\\n•Inheritance between classes of an object-oriented program.\\n•Scheduling constraints between the tasks of a project.\\nWe explore this latter application further in the following example:\\nExample 14.20: In order to manage a large project, it is convenient to break it up\\ninto a collection of smaller tasks. The tasks, however, are rarely independent, be-\\ncause scheduling constraints exist between them. (For example, in a house building\\nproject, the task of ordering nails obviously precedes the task of nailing shingles\\nto the roof deck.) Clearly, scheduling constraints cannot have circularities, because\\nthey would make the project impossible. (For example, in order to get a job you\\nneed to have work experience, but in order to get work experience you need to have\\na job.) The scheduling constraints impose restrictions on the order in which the\\ntasks can be executed. Namely, if a constraint says that task amust be completed\\nbefore task bis started, then amust precede bin the order of execution of the tasks.\\nThus, if we model a feasible set of tasks as vertices of a directed graph, and we\\nplace a directed edge from utovwhenever the task for umust be executed before\\nthe task for v, then we deﬁne a directed acyclic graph.\\n14.5.1 Topological Ordering\\nThe example above motivates the following deﬁnition. Let ⃗Gbe a directed graph\\nwith nvertices. A topological ordering of⃗Gis an ordering v1,..., vnof the vertices\\nof⃗Gsuch that for every edge (vi,vj)of⃗G, it is the case that i<j. That is, a topo-\\nlogical ordering is an ordering such that any directed path in ⃗Gtraverses vertices in\\nincreasing order. Note that a directed graph may have more than one topological\\nordering. (See Figure 14.12.)\\nProposition 14.21: ⃗Ghas a topological ordering if and only if it is acyclic.\\nJustiﬁcation: The necessity (the “only if” part of the statement) is easy to\\ndemonstrate. Suppose ⃗Gis topologically ordered. Assume, for the sake of a con-\\ntradiction, that ⃗Ghas a cycle consisting of edges (vi0,vi1),(vi1,vi2),..., (vik−1,vi0).\\nBecause of the topological ordering, we must have i0<i1<···<ik−1<i0,w h i c h\\nis clearly impossible.

Let v1be such a vertex. Indeed, if v1did not exist,\\nthen in tracing a directed path from an arbitrary start vertex, we would eventuallyencounter a previously visited vertex, thus contradicting the acyclicity of ⃗G.I fw e\\nremove v\\n1from⃗G, together with its outgoing edges, the resulting directed graph is\\nstill acyclic. Hence, the resulting directed graph also has a vertex with no incomingedges, and we let v\\n2be such a vertex. By repeating this process until the directed\\ngraph becomes empty, we obtain an ordering v1,..., vnof the vertices of ⃗G. Because\\nof the construction above, if (vi,vj)is an edge of ⃗G,t h e n vimust be deleted before\\nvjcan be deleted, and thus, i<j. Therefore, v1,..., vnis a topological ordering.\\nProposition 14.21’s justiﬁcation suggests an algorithm for computing a topo-\\nlogical ordering of a directed graph, which we call topological sorting . We present\\na Python implementation of the technique in Code Fragment 14.11, and an exampleexecution of the algorithm in Figure 14.13. Our implementation uses a dictionary,\\nnamed incount , to map each vertex vto a counter that represents the current number\\nof incoming edges to v, excluding those coming from vertices that have previously\\nbeen added to the topological order. Technically, a Python dictionary provides O(1)\\nexpected time access to entries, rather than worst-case time; as was the case with\\nour graph traversals, this could be converted to worst-case time if vertices could be\\nindexed from 0 to n−1, or if we store the counter as an element of a vertex.\\nAs a side effect, the topological sorting algorithm of Code Fragment 14.11\\nalso tests whether the given directed graph ⃗Gis acyclic. Indeed, if the algorithm\\nterminates without ordering all the vertices, then the subgraph of the vertices thathave not been ordered must contain a directed cycle.'),\n",

Itis natural, therefore, to consider graphs whose edges are not weighted equally.\\n14.6.1 Weighted Graphs\\nAweighted graph is a graph that has a numeric (for example, integer) label w(e)\\nassociated with each edge e, called the weight of edge e.F o r e=( u,v),w el e t\\nnotation w(u,v)= w(e).

Graph Algorithms\\nDeﬁning Shortest Paths in a Weighted Graph\\nLet Gbe a weighted graph. The length (or weight) of a path is the sum of the\\nweights of the edges of P.T h a ti s ,i f P=( ( v0,v1),(v1,v2),..., (vk−1,vk)), then the\\nlength of P, denoted w(P),i sd e ﬁ n e da s\\nw(P)=k−1\\n∑\\ni=0w(vi,vi+1).\\nThedistance from a vertex uto a vertex vinG, denoted d(u,v), is the length of a\\nminimum-length path (also called shortest path ) from utov, if such a path exists.\\nPeople often use the convention that d(u,v)=∞if there is no path at all from\\nutovinG. Even if there is a path from utovinG, however, if there is a cycle\\ninGwhose total weight is negative, the distance from utovmay not be deﬁned.\\nFor example, suppose vertices in Grepresent cities, and the weights of edges in\\nGrepresent how much money it costs to go from one city to another. If someone\\nwere willing to actually pay us to go from say JFK to ORD, then the “cost” of the\\nedge (JFK,ORD) would be negative. If someone else were willing to pay us to gofrom ORD to JFK, then there would be a negative-weight cycle in Gand distances\\nwould no longer be deﬁned. That is, anyone could now build a path (with cycles)inGfrom any city Ato another city Bthat ﬁrst goes to JFK and then cycles as\\nmany times as he or she likes from JFK to ORD and back, before going on to B.\\nThe existence of such paths would allow us to build arbitrarily low negative-costpaths (and, in this case, make a fortune in the process). But distances cannot bearbitrarily low negative numbers. Thus, any time we use edge weights to representdistances, we must be careful not to introduce any negative-weight cycles.\\nSuppose we are given a weighted graph G, and we are asked to ﬁnd a shortest\\npath from some vertex sto each other vertex in G, viewing the weights on the edges\\nas distances. In this section, we explore efﬁcient ways of ﬁnding all such shortestpaths, if they exist. The ﬁrst algorithm we discuss is for the simple, yet common,case when all the edge weights in Gare nonnegative (that is, w(e)≥0 for each edge\\neofG); hence, we know in advance that there are no negative-weight cycles in G.\\nRecall that the special case of computing a shortest path when all weights are equal\\nto one was solved with the BFS traversal algorithm presented in Section 14.3.3.\\nThere is an interesting approach for solving this single-source problem based\\non\\nthegreedy method design pattern (Section 13.4.2). Recall that in this pattern we\\nsolve the problem at hand by repeatedly selecting the best choice from among those\\navailable in each iteration. This paradigm can often be used in situations where weare trying to optimize some cost function over a collection of objects. We can addobjects to our collection, one at a time, always picking the next one that optimizes\\nthe function from among those yet to be chosen.'),\n",

Shortest Paths 661\\n14.6.2 Dijkstra’s Algorithm\\nThe main idea in applying the greedy method pattern to the single-source shortest-\\npath problem is to perform a “weighted” breadth-ﬁrst search starting at the sourcevertex s. In particular, we can use the greedy method to develop an algorithm that\\niteratively grows a “cloud” of vertices out of s, with the vertices entering the cloud\\nin order of their distances from s. Thus, in each iteration, the next vertex chosen\\nis the vertex outside the cloud that is closest to s. The algorithm terminates when\\nno more vertices are outside the cloud (or when those outside the cloud are not\\nconnected to those within the cloud), at which point we have a shortest path from\\nsto every vertex of Gthat is reachable from s. This approach is a simple, but\\nnevertheless powerful, example of the greedy method design pattern. Applying thegreedy method to the single-source, shortest-path problem, results in an algorithmknown as Dijkstra’s algorithm .\\nEdge Relaxation\\nLet us deﬁne a label D[v]for each vertex vinV, which we use to approximate the\\ndistance in Gfrom stov. The meaning of these labels is that D[v]will always store\\nthe length of the best path we have found so far from stov. Initially, D[s]=0a n d\\nD[v]=∞for each v̸=s, and we deﬁne the set C, which is our “ cloud ” of vertices,\\nto initially be the empty set. At each iteration of the algorithm, we select a vertex\\nunot in Cwith smallest D[u]label, and we pull uinto C. (In general, we will use\\na priority queue to select among the vertices outside the cloud.) In the very ﬁrst\\niteration we will, of course, pull sinto C. Once a new vertex uis pulled into C,w e\\nthen update the label D[v]of each vertex vthat is adjacent to uand is outside of\\nC, to reﬂect the fact that there may be a new and better way to get to vvia u.T h i s\\nupdate operation is known as a relaxation procedure, for it takes an old estimate\\nand checks if it can be improved to get closer to its true value.

(Continued from Fig-\\nure 14.16.)\\nWhy It Works\\nThe interesting aspect of the Dijkstra algorithm is that, at the moment a vertex u\\nis pulled into C, its label D[u]stores the correct length of a shortest path from v\\ntou. Thus, when the algorithm terminates, it will have computed the shortest-path\\ndistance from sto every vertex of G. That is, it will have solved the single-source\\nshortest-path problem.\\nIt is probably not immediately clear why Dijkstra’s algorithm correctly ﬁnds the\\nshortest path from the start vertex sto each other vertex uin the graph. Why is it\\nthat the distance from stouis equal to the value of the label D[u]at the time vertex\\nuis removed from the priority queue Qand added to the cloud C? The answer\\nto this question depends on there being no negative-weight edges in the graph, for\\nit allows the greedy method to work correctly, as we show in the proposition that\\nfollows.\\nProposition 14.23: In Dijkstra’s algorithm, whenever a vertex vis pulled into the\\ncloud, the label D[v]is equal to d(s,v), the length of a shortest path from stov.\\nJustiﬁcation: Suppose that D[v]>d(s,v)for some vertex vinV,a n dl e t z\\nbe the ﬁrst vertex the algorithm pulled into the cloud C(that is, removed from\\nQ) such that D[z]>d(s,z). There is a shortest path Pfrom stoz(for otherwise\\nd(s,z)=∞=D[z]). Let us therefore consider the moment when zis pulled into\\nC,a n dl e t ybe the ﬁrst vertex of P(when going from stoz) that is not in Cat this\\nmoment. Let xbe the predecessor of yin path P(note that we could have x=s).\\n(See Figure 14.18.) We know, by our choice of y,t h a t xis already in Cat this point.'),\n",

This data structure allows us to step through the\\nvertices adjacent to uduring the relaxation step in time proportional to their number.\\nTherefore, the time spent in the management of the nested forloop, and the number\\nof iterations of that loop, is\\n∑\\nuinVGoutdeg (u),\\nwhich is O(m)by Proposition 14.9. The outer while loop executes O(n)times,\\nsince a new vertex is added to the cloud during each iteration. This still does notsettle all the details for the algorithm analysis, however, for we must say more about\\nhow to implement the other principal data structure in the algorithm—the priority\\nqueue Q.\\nReferring back to Code Fragment 14.12 in search of priority queue operations,\\nwe ﬁnd that nvertices are originally inserted into the priority queue; since these are\\nthe only insertions, the maximum size of the queue is n. In each of niterations of\\nthewhile loop, a call to remove\\nminis made to extract the vertex uwith smallest\\nDlabel from Q. Then, for each neighbor vofu, we perform an edge relaxation,\\nand may potentially update the key of vin the queue. Thus, we actually need an\\nimplementation of an adaptable priority queue (Section 9.5), in which case the key\\nof a vertex vis changed using the method update (ℓ,k),w h e r e ℓis the locator for\\nthe priority queue entry associated with vertex v. In the worst case, there could be\\none such update for each edge of the graph. Overall, the running time of Dijkstra’salgorithm is bounded by the sum of the following:\\n•ninsertions into Q.\\n•ncalls to the remove\\nminmethod on Q.\\n•mcalls to the update method on Q.\\nIfQis an adaptable priority queue implemented as a heap, then each of the\\nabove operations run in O(logn), and so the overall running time for Dijkstra’s\\nalgorithm is O((n+m)logn). Note that if we wish to express the running time as a\\nfunction of nonly, then it is O(n2logn)in the worst case.\\nLet us now consider an alternative implementation for the adaptable priority\\nqueue Qusing an unsorted sequence.

Algorithms for ﬁnding such a tree are the focus ofthis section.\\nProblem Deﬁnition\\nGiven an undirected, weighted graph G, we are interested in ﬁnding a tree Tthat\\ncontains all the vertices in Gand minimizes the sum\\nw(T)= ∑\\n(u,v)inTw(u,v).\\nA tree, such as this, that contains every vertex of a connected graph Gis said to\\nbe a spanning tree , and the problem of computing a spanning tree Twith smallest\\ntotal weight is known as the minimum spanning tree (orMST ) problem.\\nThe development of efﬁcient algorithms for the minimum spanning tree prob-\\nlem predates the modern notion of computer science itself. In this section, we\\ndiscuss two classic algorithms for solving the MST problem. These algorithms\\nare both applications of the greedy method , which, as was discussed brieﬂy in the\\nprevious section, is based on choosing objects to join a growing collection by it-eratively picking an object that minimizes some cost function. The ﬁrst algorithmwe discuss is the Prim-Jarn ´ ık algorithm, which grows the MST from a single root\\nvertex, much in the same way as Dijkstra’s shortest-path algorithm. The secondalgorithm we discuss is Kruskal’s algorithm, which “grows” the MST in clustersby considering edges in nondecreasing order of their weights.\\nIn order to simplify the description of the algorithms, we assume, in the follow-\\ning, that the input graph Gis undirected (that is, all its edges are undirected) and\\nsimple (that is, it has no self-loops and no parallel edges). Hence, we denote theedges of Gas unordered vertex pairs (u,v).\\nBefore we discuss the details of these algorithms, however, let us give a crucial\\nfact about minimum spanning trees that forms the basis of the algorithms.'),\n",

If we remove ffrom T∪{e}, we obtain a spanning\\ntree whose total weight is no more than before. Since Twas a minimum spanning\\ntree, this new tree must also be a minimum spanning tree.\\nIn fact, if the weights in Gare distinct, then the minimum spanning tree is\\nunique; we leave the justiﬁcation of this less crucial fact as an exercise (C-14.65).\\nIn addition, note that Proposition 14.25 remains valid even if the graph Gcon-\\ntains negative-weight edges or negative-weight cycles, unlike the algorithms we\\npresented for shortest paths.'),\n",

Graph Algorithms\\n14.7.1 Prim-Jarn ´ ık Algorithm\\nIn the Prim-Jarn ´ ık algorithm, we grow a minimum spanning tree from a single\\ncluster starting from some “root” vertex s. The main idea is similar to that of\\nDijkstra’s algorithm. We begin with some vertex s, deﬁning the initial “cloud” of\\nvertices C. Then, in each iteration, we choose a minimum-weight edge e=(u,v),\\nconnecting a vertex uin the cloud Cto a vertex voutside of C. The vertex vis\\nthen brought into the cloud Cand the process is repeated until a spanning tree is\\nformed. Again, the crucial fact about minimum spanning trees comes into play,\\nfor by always choosing the smallest-weight edge joining a vertex inside Cto one\\noutside C, we are assured of always adding a valid edge to the MST.\\nTo efﬁciently implement this approach, we can take another cue from Dijkstra’s\\nalgorithm. We maintain a label D[v]for each vertex voutside the cloud C,s ot h a t\\nD[v]stores the weight of the minimum observed edge for joining vto the cloud\\nC. (In Dijkstra’s algorithm, this label measured the full path length from starting\\nvertex stov, including an edge (u,v).) These labels serve as keys in a priority\\nqueue used to decide which vertex is next in line to join the cloud.

Graph Algorithms\\n14.7.2 Kruskal’s Algorithm\\nIn this section, we introduce Kruskal’s algorithm for constructing a minimum span-\\nning tree. While the Prim-Jarn ´ ık algorithm builds the MST by growing a single tree\\nuntil it spans the graph, Kruskal’s algorithm maintains a forest of clusters, repeat-\\nedly merging pairs of clusters until a single cluster spans the graph.\\nInitially, each vertex is by itself in a singleton cluster. The algorithm then\\nconsiders each edge in turn, ordered by increasing weight. If an edge econnects\\ntwo different clusters, then eis added to the set of edges of the minimum spanning\\ntree, and the two clusters connected by eare merged into a single cluster. If, on the\\nother hand, econnects two vertices that are already in the same cluster, then eis\\ndiscarded. Once the algorithm has added enough edges to form a spanning tree, it\\nterminates and outputs this tree as the minimum spanning tree.\\nWe give pseudo-code for Kruskal’s MST algorithm in Code Fragment 14.17\\nand we show an example of this algorithm in Figures 14.22, 14.23, and 14.24.\\nAlgorithm Kruskal( G):\\nInput: A simple connected weighted graph Gwith nvertices and medges\\nOutput: A minimum spanning tree TforG\\nforeach vertex vinGdo\\nDeﬁne an elementary cluster C(v)={v}.\\nInitialize a priority queue Qto contain all edges in G,u s i n gt h ew e i g h t sa sk e y s .\\nT=∅ {Twill ultimately contain the edges of the MST }\\nwhile Thas fewer than n−1 edges do\\n(u,v)=value returned by Q.remove\\n min ()\\nLet C(u)be the cluster containing u,a n dl e t C(v)be the cluster containing v.\\nifC(u)̸=C(v)then\\nAdd edge (u,v)toT.\\nMerge C(u)and C(v)into one cluster.\\nreturn tree T\\nCode Fragment 14.17: Kruskal’s algorithm for the MST problem.\\nAs was the case with the Prim-Jarn ´ ık algorithm, the correctness of Kruskal’s al-\\ngorithm is based upon the crucial fact about minimum spanning trees from Propo-\\nsition 14.25. Each time Kruskal’s algorithm adds an edge (u,v)to the minimum\\nspanning tree T, we can deﬁne a partitioning of the set of vertices V(as in the\\nproposition) by letting V1be the cluster containing vand letting V2contain the rest\\nof the vertices in V. This clearly deﬁnes a disjoint partitioning of the vertices of\\nVand, more importantly, since we are extracting edges from Qin order by their\\nweights, emust be a minimum-weight edge with one vertex in V1and the other in\\nV2.

If that queue is implemented with\\na heap, we can initialize QinO(mlogm)time by repeated insertions, or in O(m)\\ntime using bottom-up heap construction (see Section 9.3.6), and the subsequent\\ncalls to remove\\nmineach run in O(logm)time, since the queue has size O(m).W e\\nnote that since misO(n2)for a simple graph, O(logm)is the same as O(logn).\\nTherefore, the running time due to the ordering of edges is O(mlogn).\\nThe remaining task is the management of clusters. To implement Kruskal’s\\nalgorithm, we must be able to ﬁnd the clusters for vertices uand vthat are endpoints\\nof an edge e, to test whether those two clusters are distinct, and if so, to merge\\nthose two clusters into one. None of the data structures we have studied thus farare well suited for this task. However, we conclude this chapter by formalizing\\nthe problem of managing disjoint partitions , and introducing efﬁcient union-ﬁnd\\ndata structures. In the context of Kruskal’s algorithm, we perform at most 2 m\\nﬁnd operations and n−1 union operations. We will see that a simple union-ﬁnd\\nstructure can perform that combination of operations in O(m+nlogn)time (see\\nProposition 14.26), and a more advanced structure can support an even faster time.\\nFor a connected graph, m≥n−1, and therefore, the bound of O(mlogn)time\\nfor ordering the edges dominates the time for managing the clusters. We conclude\\nthat the running time of Kruskal’s algorithm is O(mlogn).'),\n",

Minimum Spanning Trees 681\\n14.7.3 Disjoint Partitions and Union-Find Structures\\nIn this section, we consider a data structure for managing a partition of elements\\ninto a collection of disjoint sets. Our initial motivation is in support of Kruskal’s\\nminimum spanning tree algorithm, in which a forest of disjoint trees is maintained,\\nwith occasional merging of neighboring trees. More generally, the disjoint partition\\nproblem can be applied to various models of discrete growth.\\nWe formalize the problem with the following model. A partition data structure\\nmanages a universe of elements that are organized into disjoint sets (that is, anelement belongs to one and only one of these sets). Unlike with the Set ADT orPython’s setclass, we do not expect to be able to iterate through the contents of a\\nset, nor to efﬁciently test whether a given set includes a given element. To avoid\\nconfusion with such notions of a set, we will refer to the clusters of our partition as\\ngroups . However, we will not require an explicit structure for each group, instead\\nallowing the organization of groups to be implicit. To differentiate between onegroup and another, we assume that at any point in time, each group has a designatedentry that we refer to as the leader of the group.\\nFormally, we deﬁne the methods of a partition ADT using position objects,\\neach of which stores an element x. The partition ADT supports the following meth-\\nods.\\nmake\\ngroup(x): Create a singleton group containing new element xand\\nreturn the position storing x.\\nunion(p, q): Merge the groups containing positions pandq.\\nﬁnd(p) :Return the position of the leader of the group containingposition p.\\nSequence Implementation\\nA simple implementation of a partition with a total of nelements uses a collection\\nof sequences, one for each group, where the sequence for a group Astores element\\npositions. Each position object stores a variable, element , which references its\\nassociated element xand allows the execution of an element ()method in O(1)time.\\nIn addition, each position stores a variable, group , that references the sequence\\nstoring p, since this sequence is representing the group containing p’s element.\\n(See Figure 14.25.)\\nWith this representation, we can easily perform the make\\n group (x)andﬁnd (p)\\noperations in O(1)time, allowing the ﬁrst position in a sequence to serve as the\\n“leader.” Operation union (p,q)requires that we join two sequences into one and\\nupdate the group references of the positions in one of the two. We choose to imple-\\nment this operation by removing all the positions from the sequence with smaller'),\n",

Each time we take a po-\\nsition from the smaller group aand insert it into the larger group b, we update the\\ngroup reference for that position to now point to b. Hence, the operation union (p,q)\\ntakes time O(min (np,nq)),w h e r e np(resp. nq) is the cardinality of the group con-\\ntaining position p(resp. q). Clearly, this time is O(n)if there are nelements in the\\npartition universe. However, we next present an amortized analysis that shows thisimplementation to be much better than appears from this worst-case analysis.\\nProposition 14.26:\\nWhen using the above sequence-based partition implementa-\\ntion, performing a series of kmake\\n group ,union ,a n dﬁndoperations on an initially\\nempty partition involving at most nelements takes O(k+nlogn)time.\\nJustiﬁcation: We use the accounting method and assume that one cyber-dollar\\ncan pay for the time to perform a ﬁnd operation, a make\\n group operation, or the\\nmovement of a position object from one sequence to another in a union operation.\\nIn the case of a ﬁnd ormake\\n group operation, we charge the operation itself 1\\ncyber-dollar. In the case of a union operation, we assume that 1 cyber-dollar pays\\nfor the constant-time work in comparing the sizes of the two sequences, and that\\nwe charge 1 cyber-dollar to each position that we move from the smaller group to\\nthe larger group. Clearly, the 1 cyber-dollar charged for each ﬁndandmake\\n group\\noperation, together with the ﬁrst cyber-dollar collected for each union operation,\\naccounts for a total of kcyber-dollars.\\nConsider, then, the number of charges made to positions on behalf of union\\noperations. The important observation is that each time we move a position fromone group to another, the size of that position’s group at least doubles. Thus, eachposition is moved from one group to another at most log ntimes; hence, each po-\\nsition can be charged at most O(logn)times. Since we assume that the partition is\\ninitially empty, there are O(n)different elements referenced in the given series of\\noperations, which implies that the total time for moving elements during the union\\noperations is O(nlogn).\\n'),\n",

Memory Management and B-Trees\\nOur study of data structures thus far has focused primarily upon the efﬁciency\\nof computations, as measured by the number of primitive operations that are exe-\\ncuted on a central processing unit (CPU). In practice, the performance of a com-puter system is also greatly impacted by the management of the computer’s memorysystems. In our analysis of data structures, we have provided asymptotic bounds forthe overall amount of memory used by a data structure. In this chapter, we consider\\nmore subtle issues involving the use of a computer’s memory system.\\nWe ﬁrst discuss ways in which memory is allocated and deallocated during the\\nexecution of a computer program, and the impact that this has on the program’sperformance. Second, we discuss the complexity of multilevel memory hierarchies\\nin today’s computer systems. Although we often abstract a computer’s memoryas consisting of a single pool of interchangeable locations, in practice, the dataused by an executing program is stored and transferred between a combinationof physical memories (e.g., CPU registers, caches, internal memory, and external\\nmemory). We consider the use of classic data structures in the algorithms used to\\nmanage memory, and how the use of memory hierarchies impacts the choice of\\ndata structures and algorithms for classic problems such as searching and sorting.\\n15.1 Memory Management\\nIn order to implement any data structure on an actual computer, we need to use\\ncomputer memory. Computer memory is organized into a sequence of words , each\\nof which typically consists of 4, 8, or 16 bytes (depending on the computer). These\\nmemory words are numbered from 0 to N−1, where Nis the number of mem-\\nory words available to the computer. The number associated with each memoryword is known as its memory address . Thus, the memory in a computer can be\\nviewed as basically one giant array of memory words. For example, in Figure 5.1\\nof Section 5.2, we portrayed a section of the computer’s memory as follows:\\n2160 21452146214721482149215021512152215321542155215621572158 2144 2159\\nIn order to run programs and store information, the computer’s memory must\\nbemanaged so as to determine what data is stored in what memory cells. In this\\nsection, we discuss the basics of memory management, most notably describing the\\nway in which memory is allocated to store new objects, the way in which portionsof memory are deallocated and reclaimed, when no longer needed, and the way in\\nwhich the Python interpreter uses memory in completing its tasks.'),\n",

Memory Management 699\\n15.1.1 Memory Allocation\\nWith Python, all objects are stored in a pool of memory, known as the memory\\nheap orPython heap (which should not be confused with the “heap” data structure\\npresented in Chapter 9). When a command such as\\nw=W i d g e t ( )\\nis executed, assuming Widget is the name of a class, a new instance of the class\\nis created and stored somewhere within the memory heap. The Python interpreter\\nis responsible for negotiating the use of space with the operating system and formanaging the use of the memory heap when executing a Python program.\\nThe storage available in the memory heap is divided into blocks , which are con-\\ntiguous array-like “chunks” of memory that may be of variable or ﬁxed sizes. The\\nsystem must be implemented so that it can quickly allocate memory for new ob-\\njects. One popular method is to keep contiguous “holes” of available free memoryin a linked list, called the free list . The links joining these holes are stored inside\\nthe holes themselves, since their memory is not being used. As memory is allocatedand deallocated, the collection of holes in the free lists changes, with the unused\\nmemory being separated into disjoint holes divided by blocks of used memory. This\\nseparation of unused memory into separate holes is known as fragmentation .T h e\\nproblem is that it becomes more difﬁcult to ﬁnd large continuous chunks of mem-\\nory, when needed, even though an equivalent amount of memory may be unused(yet fragmented). Therefore, we would like to minimize fragmentation as much as\\npossible.\\nThere are two kinds of fragmentation that can occur. Internal fragmentation\\noccurs when a portion of an allocated memory block is unused. For example, a\\nprogram may request an array of size 1000, but only use the ﬁrst 100 cells of thisarray. There is not much that a run-time environment can do to reduce internalfragmentation. External fragmentation , on the other hand, occurs when there is a\\nsigniﬁcant amount of unused memory between several contiguous blocks of allo-cated memory. Since the run-time environment has control over where to allocatememory when it is requested, the run-time environment should allocate memory ina way to try to reduce external fragmentation as much as reasonably possible.\\nSeveral heuristics have been suggested for allocating memory from the heap\\nso as to minimize external fragmentation. The best-ﬁt algorithm searches the en-\\ntire free list to ﬁnd the hole whose size is closest to the amount of memory being\\nrequested. The ﬁrst-ﬁt algorithm searches from the beginning of the free list for\\nthe ﬁrst hole that is large enough. The next-ﬁt algorithm is similar, in that it also\\nsearches the free list for the ﬁrst hole that is large enough, but it begins its search\\nfrom where it left off previously, viewing the free list as a circularly linked list(Section 7.2). The worst-ﬁt algorithm searches the free list to ﬁnd the largest hole\\nof available memory, which might be done faster than a search of the entire free list'),\n",

Memory Management and B-Trees\\nif this list were maintained as a priority queue (Chapter 9). In each algorithm, the\\nrequested amount of memory is subtracted from the chosen memory hole and the\\nleftover part of that hole is returned to the free list.\\nAlthough it might sound good at ﬁrst, the best-ﬁt algorithm tends to produce\\nthe worst external fragmentation, since the leftover parts of the chosen holes tendto be small. The ﬁrst-ﬁt algorithm is fast, but it tends to produce a lot of external\\nfragmentation at the front of the free list, which slows down future searches. The\\nnext-ﬁt algorithm spreads fragmentation more evenly throughout the memory heap,thus keeping search times low. This spreading also makes it more difﬁcult to allo-cate large blocks, however. The worst-ﬁt algorithm attempts to avoid this problem\\nby keeping contiguous sections of free memory as large as possible.\\n15.1.2 Garbage Collection\\nIn some languages, like C and C++, the memory space for objects must be explic-\\nitly deallocated by the programmer, which is a duty often overlooked by beginningprogrammers and is the source of frustrating programming errors even for experi-\\nenced programmers. The designers of Python instead placed the burden of memory\\nmanagement entirely on the interpreter. The process of detecting “stale” objects,deallocating the space devoted to those objects, and returning the reclaimed spaceto the free list is known as garbage collection .\\nTo perform automated garbage collection, there must ﬁrst be a way to detect\\nthose objects that are no longer necessary. Since the interpreter cannot feasiblyanalyze the semantics of an arbitrary Python program, it relies on the followingconservative rule for reclaiming objects. In order for a program to access an object,it must have a direct or indirect reference to that object. We will deﬁne such objects\\nto be live objects . In deﬁning a live object, a direct reference to an object is in the\\nform of an identiﬁer in an active namespace (i.e., the global namespace, or the local\\nnamespace for any active function). For example, immediately after the commandw=W i d g e t ( ) is executed, identiﬁer wwill be deﬁned in the current namespace\\nas a reference to the new widget object. We refer to all such objects with direct\\nreferences as root objects .A n indirect reference to a live object is a reference\\nthat occurs within the state of some other live object. For example, if the widget\\ninstance in our earlier example maintains a list as an attribute, that list is also a liveobject (as it can be reached indirectly through use of identiﬁer w). The set of live\\nobjects are deﬁned recursively; thus, any objects that are referenced within the listthat is referenced by the widget are also classiﬁed as live objects.\\nThe Python interpreter assumes that live objects are the active objects currently\\nbeing used by the running program; these objects should notbe deallocated. Other\\nobjects can be garbage collected. Python relies on the following two strategies for\\ndetermining which objects are live.'),\n",

Memory Management 701\\nReference Counts\\nWithin the state of every Python object is an integer known as its reference count .\\nThis is the count of how many references to the object exist anywhere in the system.\\nEvery time a reference is assigned to this object, its reference count is incremented,and every time one of those references is reassigned to something else, the reference\\ncount for the former object is decremented. The maintenance of a reference count\\nfor each object adds O(1)space per object, and the increments and decrements to\\nthe count add O(1)additional computation time per such operations.\\nThe Python interpreter allows a running program to examine an object’s ref-\\nerence count. Within the sysmodule there is a function named getrefcount that\\nreturns an integer equal to the reference count for the object sent as a parameter. Itis worth noting that because the formal parameter of that function is assigned to theactual parameter sent by the caller, there is temporarily one additional reference to\\nthat object in the local namespace of the function at the time the count is reported.\\nThe advantage of having a reference count for each object is that if an object’s\\ncount is ever decremented to zero, that object cannot possibly be a live object andtherefore the system can immediately deallocate the object (or place it in a queue\\nof objects that are ready to be deallocated).\\nCycle Detection\\nAlthough it is clear that an object with a reference count of zero cannot be a liveobject, it is important to recognize that an object with a nonzero reference countneed not qualify as live. There may exist a group of objects that have references to\\neach other, even though none of those objects are reachable from a root object.\\nFor example, a running Python program may have an identiﬁer, data,t h a ti sa\\nreference to a sequence implemented using a doubly linked list. In this case, the\\nlist referenced by data is a root object, the header and trailer nodes that are stored\\nas attributes of the list are live objects, as are all the intermediate nodes of the list\\nthat are indirectly referenced and all the elements that are referenced as elementsof those nodes. If the identiﬁer, data, were to go out of scope, or to be reassigned\\nto some other object, the reference count for the list instance may go to zero and\\nbe garbage collected, but the reference counts for all of the nodes would remain\\nnonzero, stopping them from being garbage collected by the simple rule above.\\nEvery so often, in particular when the available space in the memory heap is\\nbecoming scarce, the Python interpreter uses a more advanced form of garbagecollection to reclaim objects that are unreachable, despite their nonzero referencecounts. There are different algorithms for implementing cycle detection. (Themechanics of garbage collection in Python are abstracted in the gcmodule, and\\nmay vary depending on the implementation of the interpreter.) A classic algorithm\\nfor garbage collection is the mark-sweep algorithm , which we next discuss.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Michel T.Goodrich ,Roberto Tamassia, Michel H.Gold wasser, Data Structures and Algorithms in Python.pdf', 'page': 723}, page_content='702 Chapter 15. Memory Management and B-Trees\\nThe Mark-Sweep Algorithm\\nIn the mark-sweep garbage collection algorithm, we associate a “mark” bit with\\neach object that identiﬁes whether that object is live. When we determine at somepoint that garbage collection is needed, we suspend all other activity and clearthe mark bits of all the objects currently allocated in the memory heap. We then\\ntrace through the active namespaces and we mark all the root objects as “live.” We\\nmust then determine all the other live objects—the ones that are reachable from the\\nroot objects. To do this efﬁciently, we can perform a depth-ﬁrst search (see Sec-\\ntion 14.3.1) on the directed graph that is deﬁned by objects reference other objects.In this case, each object in the memory heap is viewed as a vertex in a directed\\ngraph, and the reference from one object to another is viewed as a directed edge.\\nBy performing a directed DFS from each root object, we can correctly identify andmark each live object. This process is known as the “mark” phase. Once this pro-cess has completed, we then scan through the memory heap and reclaim any space\\nthat is being used for an object that has not been marked. At this time, we can also\\noptionally coalesce all the allocated space in the memory heap into a single block,thereby eliminating external fragmentation for the time being. This scanning andreclamation process is known as the “sweep” phase, and when it completes, weresume running the suspended program. Thus, the mark-sweep garbage collec-\\ntion algorithm will reclaim unused space in time proportional to the number of live\\nobjects and their references plus the size of the memory heap.\\nPerforming DFS In-Place\\nThe mark-sweep algorithm correctly reclaims unused space in the memory heap,but there is an important issue we must face during the mark phase. Since we arereclaiming memory space at a time when available memory is scarce, we must take\\ncare not to use extra space during the garbage collection itself. The trouble is that\\nthe DFS algorithm, in the recursive way we have described it in Section 14.3.1, canuse space proportional to the number of vertices in the graph. In the case of garbagecollection, the vertices in our graph are the objects in the memory heap; hence, weprobably do not have this much memory to use. So our only alternative is to ﬁnd a\\nway to perform DFS in-place rather than recursively, that is, we must perform DFS\\nusing only a constant amount of additional storage.\\nThe main idea for performing DFS in-place is to simulate the recursion stack\\nusing the edges of the graph (which in the case of garbage collection correspondto object references). When we traverse an edge from a visited vertex vto a new\\nvertex w, we change the edge (v,w)stored in v’s adjacency list to point back to v’s\\nparent in the DFS tree. When we return back to v(simulating the return from the\\n“recursive” call at w), we can then switch the edge we modiﬁed to point back to w,\\nassuming we have some way to identify which edge we need to change back.'),\n",

Memory Management 703\\n15.1.3 Additional Memory Used by the Python Interpreter\\nWe have discussed, in Section 15.1.1, how the Python interpreter allocates memory\\nfor objects within a memory heap. However, this is not the only memory that isused when executing a Python program. In this section, we discuss some otherimportant uses of memory.\\nThe Run-Time Call Stack\\nStacks have a most important application to the run-time environment of Python\\nprograms. A running Python program has a private stack, known as the call stack\\norPython interpreter stack , that is used to keep track of the nested sequence of\\ncurrently active (that is, nonterminated) invocations of functions. Each entry of\\nthe stack is a structure known as an activation record orframe , storing important\\ninformation about an invocation of a function.\\nAt the top of the call stack is the activation record of the running call ,t h a ti s ,\\nthe function activation that currently has control of the execution. The remainingelements of the stack are activation records of the suspended calls , that is, func-\\ntions that have invoked another function and are currently waiting for that other\\nfunction to return control when it terminates. The order of the elements in the stack\\ncorresponds to the chain of invocations of the currently active functions. When anew function is called, an activation record for that call is pushed onto the stack.When it terminates, its activation record is popped from the stack and the Python\\ninterpreter resumes the processing of the previously suspended call.\\nEach activation record includes a dictionary representing the local namespace\\nfor the function call. (See Sections 1.10 and 2.5 for further discussion of name-\\nspaces). The namespace maps identiﬁers, which serve as parameters and local\\nvariables, to object values, although the objects being referenced still reside in the\\nmemory heap. The activation record for a function call also includes a reference tothe function deﬁnition itself, and a special variable, known as the program counter ,\\nto maintain the address of the statement within the function that is currently exe-\\ncuting. When one function returns control to another, the stored program counter\\nfor the suspended function allows the interpreter to properly continue execution ofthat function.\\nImplementing Recursion\\nOne of the beneﬁts of using a stack to implement the nesting of function calls isthat it allows programs to use recursion . That is, it allows a function to call it-\\nself, as discussed in Chapter 4. We implicitly described the concept of the call\\nstack and the use of activation records within our portrayal of recursion traces in'),\n",

Memory Management and B-Trees\\nthat chapter. Interestingly, early programming languages, such as Cobol and For-\\ntran, did not originally use call stacks to implement function calls. But because of\\nthe elegance and efﬁciency that recursion allows, almost all modern programminglanguages utilize a call stack for function calls, including the current versions ofclassic languages like Cobol and Fortran.\\nEach box of a recursive trace corresponds to an activation record that is placed\\non the call stack during the execution of a recursive function. At any point intime, the content of the call stack corresponds to the chain of boxes from the initialfunction invocation to the current one. To better illustrate how a call stack is usedby recursive functions, we refer back to the Python implementation of the classic\\nrecursive deﬁnition of the factorial function,\\nn!=n(n−1)(n−2)···1,\\nwith the code originally given in Code Fragment 4.1, and the recursive trace inFigure 4.1. The ﬁrst time we call factorial , its activation record includes a name-\\nspace storing the parameter value n. The function recursively calls itself to com-\\npute (n−1)!, causing a new activation record, with its own namespace and param-\\neter, to be pushed onto the call stack. In turn, this recursive invocation calls itself tocompute (n−2)!, and so on. The chain of recursive invocations, and thus the call\\nstack, grows up to size n+1, with the most deeply nested call being factorial (0),\\nwhich returns 1 without any further recursion. The run-time stack allows several\\ninvocations of the factorial function to exist simultaneously. Each has an activation\\nrecord that stores the value of its parameter, and eventually the value to be returned.\\nWhen the ﬁrst recursive call eventually terminates, it returns (n−1)!, which is then\\nmultiplied by nto compute n! for the original call of the factorial method.\\nThe Operand Stack\\nInterestingly, there is actually another place where the Python interpreter uses astack. Arithmetic expressions, such as ((a+b)∗(c+d))/e, are evaluated by the\\ninterpreter using an operand stack . In Section 8.5 we described how to evaluate an\\narithmetic expression using a postorder traversal of an explicit expression tree. We\\ndescribed that algorithm in a recursive way; however, this recursive description can\\nbe simulated using a nonrecursive process that maintains an explicit operand stack.\\nA simple binary operation, such as a+b, is computed by pushing aon the stack,\\npushing bon the stack, and then calling an instruction that pops the top two items\\nfrom the stack, performs the binary operation on them, and pushes the result backonto the stack. Likewise, instructions for writing and reading elements to and from\\nmemory involve the use of popandpush methods for the operand stack.'),\n",

Memory Hierarchies and Caching 705\\n15.2 Memory Hierarchies and Caching\\nWith the increased use of computing in society, software applications must man-\\nage extremely large data sets. Such applications include the processing of onlineﬁnancial transactions, the organization and maintenance of databases, and analy-\\nses of customers’ purchasing histories and preferences. The amount of data can be\\nso large that the overall performance of algorithms and data structures sometimesdepends more on the time to access the data than on the speed of the CPU.\\n15.2.1 Memory Systems\\nIn order to accommodate large data sets, computers have a hierarchy of differ-\\nent kinds of memories, which vary in terms of their size and distance from theCPU. Closest to the CPU are the internal registers that the CPU itself uses. Ac-\\ncess to such locations is very fast, but there are relatively few such locations. At\\nthe second level in the hierarchy are one or more memory caches . This memory\\nis considerably larger than the register set of a CPU, but accessing it takes longer.At the third level in the hierarchy is the internal memory , which is also known as\\nmain memory orcore memory . The internal memory is considerably larger than\\nthe cache memory, but also requires more time to access. Another level in the hi-erarchy is the external memory , which usually consists of disks, CD drives, DVD\\ndrives, and/or tapes. This memory is very large, but it is also very slow. Data storedthrough an external network can be viewed as yet another level in this hierarchy,\\nwith even greater storage capacity, but even slower access. Thus, the memory hi-\\nerarchy for computers can be viewed as consisting of ﬁve or more levels, each ofwhich is larger and slower than the previous level. (See Figure 15.1.) During theexecution of a program, data is routinely copied from one level of the hierarchy toa neighboring level, and these transfers can become a computational bottleneck.\\nExternal Memory\\nInternal Memory\\nCaches\\nRegisters\\nCPUBiggerNetwork Storage Faster\\nFigure 15.1: The memory hierarchy.'),\n",

Memory Management and B-Trees\\n15.2.2 Caching Strategies\\nThe signiﬁcance of the memory hierarchy on the performance of a program de-\\npends greatly upon the size of the problem we are trying to solve and the physical\\ncharacteristics of the computer system. Often, the bottleneck occurs between two\\nlevels of the memory hierarchy—the one that can hold all data items and the leveljust below that one. For a problem that can ﬁt entirely in main memory, the twomost important levels are the cache memory and the internal memory. Access timesfor internal memory can be as much as 10 to 100 times longer than those for cache\\nmemory. It is desirable, therefore, to be able to perform most memory accesses\\nin cache memory. For a problem that does not ﬁt entirely in main memory, onthe other hand, the two most important levels are the internal memory and the ex-ternal memory. Here the differences are even more dramatic, for access times for\\ndisks, the usual general-purpose external-memory device, are typically as much as\\n100000 to 1000000 times longer than those for internal memory.\\nTo put this latter ﬁgure into perspective, imagine there is a student in Baltimore\\nwho wants to send a request-for-money message to his parents in Chicago. If the\\nstudent sends his parents an email message, it can arrive at their home computer\\nin about ﬁve seconds. Think of this mode of communication as corresponding to\\nan internal-memory access by a CPU. A mode of communication corresponding to\\nan external-memory access that is 500 ,000 times slower would be for the student\\nto walk to Chicago and deliver his message in person, which would take about a\\nmonth if he can average 20 miles per day. Thus, we should make as few accessesto external memory as possible.\\nMost algorithms are not designed with the memory hierarchy in mind, in spite\\nof the great variance between access times for the different levels. Indeed, all ofthe algorithm analyses described in this book so far have assumed that all memoryaccesses are equal. This assumption might seem, at ﬁrst, to be a great oversight—\\nand one we are only addressing now in the ﬁnal chapter—but there are good reasons\\nwhy it is actually a reasonable assumption to make.\\nOne justiﬁcation for this assumption is that it is often necessary to assume that\\nall memory accesses take the same amount of time, since speciﬁc device-dependentinformation about memory sizes is often hard to come by. In fact, informationabout memory size may be difﬁcult to get. For example, a Python program thatis designed to run on many different computer platforms cannot easily be deﬁned\\nin terms of a speciﬁc computer architecture conﬁguration. We can certainly use\\narchitecture-speciﬁc information, if we have it (and we will show how to exploitsuch information later in this chapter). But once we have optimized our softwarefor a certain architecture conﬁguration, our software will no longer be device-independent. Fortunately, such optimizations are not always necessary, primarily\\nbecause of the second justiﬁcation for the equal-time memory-access assumption.'),\n",

Memory Hierarchies and Caching 707\\nCaching and Blocking\\nAnother justiﬁcation for the memory-access equality assumption is that operating\\nsystem designers have developed general mechanisms that allow most memory\\naccesses to be fast. These mechanisms are based on two important locality-of-\\nreference properties that most software possesses:\\n•Temporal locality : If a program accesses a certain memory location, then\\nthere is increased likelihood that it accesses that same location again in the\\nnear future. For example, it is common to use the value of a counter vari-\\nable in several different expressions, including one to increment the counter’s\\nvalue. In fact, a common adage among computer architects is that a programspends 90 percent of its time in 10 percent of its code.\\n•Spatial locality : If a program accesses a certain memory location, then there\\nis increased likelihood that it soon accesses other locations that are near thisone. For example, a program using an array may be likely to access the\\nlocations of this array in a sequential or near-sequential manner.\\nComputer scientists and engineers have performed extensive software proﬁling ex-\\nperiments to justify the claim that most software possesses both of these kinds oflocality of reference. For example, a nested for loop used to repeatedly scan throughan array will exhibit both kinds of locality.\\nTemporal and spatial localities have, in turn, given rise to two fundamental\\ndesign choices for multilevel computer memory systems (which are present in theinterface between cache memory and internal memory, and also in the interfacebetween internal memory and external memory).\\nThe ﬁrst design choice is called virtual memory . This concept consists of pro-\\nviding an address space as large as the capacity of the secondary-level memory, andof transferring data located in the secondary level into the primary level, when they\\nare addressed. Virtual memory does not limit the programmer to the constraint of\\nthe internal memory size. The concept of bringing data into primary memory is\\ncalled caching , and it is motivated by temporal locality. By bringing data into pri-\\nmary memory, we are hoping that it will be accessed again soon, and we will be\\nable to respond quickly to all the requests for this data that come in the near future.\\nThe second design choice is motivated by spatial locality. Speciﬁcally, if data\\nstored at a secondary-level memory location ℓis accessed, then we bring into\\nprimary-level memory a large block of contiguous locations that include the lo-\\ncation ℓ. (See Figure 15.2.) This concept is known as blocking , and it is motivated\\nby the expectation that other secondary-level memory locations close to ℓwill soon\\nbe accessed. In the interface between cache memory and internal memory, such\\nblocks are often called cache lines , and in the interface between internal memory\\nand external memory, such blocks are often called pages .'),\n",

There is\\nstill a problem, however. Primary-level memory is much smaller than secondary-\\nlevel memory. Moreover, because memory systems use blocking, any programof substance will likely reach a point where it requests data from secondary-levelmemory, but the primary memory is already full of blocks. In order to fulﬁll therequest and maintain our use of caching and blocking, we must remove some block\\nfrom primary memory to make room for a new block from secondary memory in\\nthis case. Deciding which block to evict brings up a number of interesting datastructure and algorithm design issues.\\nCaching in Web Browsers\\nFor motivation, we consider a related problem that arises when revisiting informa-tion presented in Web pages. To exploit temporal locality of reference, it is often\\nadvantageous to store copies of Web pages in a cache memory, so these pages\\ncan be quickly retrieved when requested again. This effectively creates a two-level\\nmemory hierarchy, with the cache serving as the smaller, quicker internal memory,and the network being the external memory. In particular, suppose we have a cachememory that has m“slots” that can contain Web pages. We assume that a Web page\\ncan be placed in any slot of the cache. This is known as a fully associative cache.\\nAs a browser executes, it requests different Web pages. Each time the browser\\nrequests such a Web page p, the browser determines (using a quick test) if pis\\nunchanged and currently contained in the cache. If pis contained in the cache,\\nthen the browser satisﬁes the request using the cached copy. If pis not in the\\ncache, however, the page for pis requested over the Internet and transferred into\\nthe cache. If one of the mslots in the cache is available, then the browser assigns\\npto one of the empty slots. But if all the mcells of the cache are occupied, then\\nthe computer must determine which previously viewed Web page to evict beforebringing in pto take its place. There are, of course, many different policies that can\\nbe used to determine the page to evict.'),\n",

The overhead involved inimplementing this policy is an O(1)additional amount of work per page replace-\\nment. Moreover, there is no additional overhead for each page request, other than todetermine whether a page request is in the cache or not. Still, this policy makes no\\nattempt to take advantage of any temporal locality exhibited by a user’s browsing.'),\n",

Memory Management and B-Trees\\nThe FIFO strategy is quite simple to implement, as it only requires a queue\\nQto store references to the pages in the cache. Pages are enqueued in Qwhen\\nthey are referenced by a browser, and then are brought into the cache. When a\\npage needs to be evicted, the computer simply performs a dequeue operation on Q\\nto determine which page to evict. Thus, this policy also requires O(1)additional\\nwork per page replacement. Also, the FIFO policy incurs no additional overhead\\nfor page requests. Moreover, it tries to take some advantage of temporal locality.\\nThe LRU strategy goes a step further than the FIFO strategy, for the LRU strat-\\negy explicitly takes advantage of temporal locality as much as possible, by always\\nevicting the page that was least-recently used. From a policy point of view, this is\\nan excellent approach, but it is costly from an implementation point of view. That\\nis, its way of optimizing temporal and spatial locality is fairly costly. Implement-ing the LRU strategy requires the use of an adaptable priority queue Qthat supports\\nupdating the priority of existing pages. If Qis implemented with a sorted sequence\\nbased on a linked list, then the overhead for each page request and page replace-ment is O(1). When we insert a page in Qor update its key, the page is assigned\\nthe highest key in Qand is placed at the end of the list, which can also be done\\ninO(1)time. Even though the LRU strategy has constant-time overhead, using\\nthe implementation above, the constant factors involved, in terms of the additional\\ntime overhead and the extra space for the priority queue Q, make this policy less\\nattractive from a practical point of view.\\nSince these different page replacement policies have different trade-offs be-\\ntween implementation difﬁculty and the degree to which they seem to take advan-\\ntage of localities, it is natural for us to ask for some kind of comparative analysis\\nof these methods to see which one, if any, is the best.\\nFrom a worst-case point of view, the FIFO and LRU strategies have fairly\\nunattractive competitive behavior. For example, suppose we have a cache con-\\ntaining mpages, and consider the FIFO and LRU methods for performing page\\nreplacement for a program that has a loop that repeatedly requests m+1 pages in\\na cyclic order. Both the FIFO and LRU policies perform badly on such a sequence\\nof page requests, because they perform a page replacement on every page request.\\nThus, from a worst-case point of view, these policies are almost the worst we can\\nimagine—they require a page replacement on every page request.\\nThis worst-case analysis is a little too pessimistic, however, for it focuses on\\neach protocol’s behavior for one bad sequence of page requests. An ideal analy-\\nsis would be to compare these methods over all possible page-request sequences.\\nOf course, this is impossible to do exhaustively, but there have been a great num-ber of experimental simulations done on page-request sequences derived from realprograms. Based on these experimental comparisons, the LRU strategy has beenshown to be usually superior to the FIFO strategy, which is usually better than the\\nrandom strategy.'),\n",

External Searching and B-Trees 711\\n15.3 External Searching and B-Trees\\nConsider the problem of maintaining a large collection of items that does not ﬁt in\\nmain memory, such as a typical database. In this context, we refer to the secondary-memory blocks as disk blocks . Likewise, we refer to the transfer of a block between\\nsecondary memory and primary memory as a disk transfer . Recalling the great\\ntime difference that exists between main memory accesses and disk accesses, themain goal of maintaining such a collection in external memory is to minimize thenumber of disk transfers needed to perform a query or update. We refer to this\\ncount as the I/O complexity of the algorithm involved.\\nSome Ineﬃcient External-Memory Representations\\nA typical operation we would like to support is the search for a key in a map. If wewere to store nitems unordered in a doubly linked list, searching for a particular\\nkey within the list requires ntransfers in the worst case, since each link hop we\\nperform on the linked list might access a different block of memory.\\nWe can reduce the number of block transfers by using an array-based sequence.\\nA sequential search of an array can be performed using only O(n/B)block transfers\\nbecause of spatial locality of reference, where Bdenotes the number of elements\\nthat ﬁt into a block. This is because the block transfer when accessing the ﬁrst\\nelement of the array actually retrieves the ﬁrst Belements, and so on with each\\nsuccessive block. It is worth noting that the bound of O(n/B)transfers is only\\nachieved when using a compact array representation (see Section 5.2.2). The\\nstandard Python listclass is a referential container, and so even though the sequence\\nof references are stored in an array, the actual elements that must be examinedduring a search are not generally stored sequentially in memory, resulting in n\\ntransfers in the worst case.\\nWe could alternately store a sequence using a sorted array. In this case, a search\\nperforms O(log\\n2n)transfers, via binary search, which is a nice improvement. But\\nwe do not get signiﬁcant beneﬁt from block transfers because each query duringa binary search is likely in a different block of the sequence. As usual, update\\noperations are expensive for a sorted array.\\nSince these simple implementations are I/O inefﬁcient, we should consider the\\nlogarithmic-time internal-memory strategies that use balanced binary trees (for ex-\\nample, A VL trees or red-black trees) or other search structures with logarithmicaverage-case query and update times (for example, skip lists or splay trees). Typi-\\ncally, each node accessed for a query or update in one of these structures will be in\\na different block. Thus, these methods all require O(log\\n2n)transfers in the worst\\ncase to perform a query or update operation. But we can do better! We can performmap queries and updates using only O(log\\nBn)= O(logn/logB)transfers.'),\n",

If Tis an (a,b)tree, then\\nM(v)stores at most bentries. Let f(b)denote the time for performing a search\\nin a map, M(v). The search algorithm in an (a,b)tree is exactly like the one for\\nmultiway search trees given in Section 11.5.1. Hence, searching in an (a,b)tree T\\nwith nentries takes O(f(b)\\nlogalogn)time. Note that if bis considered a constant (and\\nthus ais also), then the search time is O(logn).\\nThe main application of (a,b)trees is for maps stored in external memory.\\nNamely, to minimize disk accesses, we select the parameters aand bso that each\\ntree node occupies a single disk block (so that f(b)=1 if we wish to simply count\\nblock transfers). Providing the right aand bvalues in this context gives rise to\\na data structure known as the B-tree, which we will describe shortly. Before we\\ndescribe this structure, however, let us discuss how insertions and removals arehandled in (a,b)trees.\\nThe insertion algorithm for an (a,b)tree is similar to that for a (2,4)tree.\\nAn overﬂow occurs when an entry is inserted into a b-node w, which becomes an\\nillegal (b+1)-node. (Recall that a node in a multiway tree is a d-node if it has d\\nchildren.) To remedy an overﬂow, we split node wby moving the median entry of w\\ninto the parent of wand replacing wwith a ⌈(b+1)/2⌉-node w\\n′and a⌊(b+1)/2⌋-\\nnode w′′. We can now see the reason for requiring a≤(b+1)/2 in the deﬁnition\\nof an (a,b)tree. Note that as a consequence of the split, we need to build the\\nsecondary structures M(w′)and M(w′′).\\nRemoving an entry from an (a,b)tree is similar to what was done for (2,4)\\ntrees. An underﬂow occurs when a key is removed from an a-node w, distinct from\\nthe root, which causes wto become an illegal (a−1)-node. To remedy an underﬂow,\\nwe perform a transfer with a sibling of wthat is not an a-node or we perform a\\nfusion of wwith a sibling that is an a-node. The new node w′resulting from the\\nfusion is a (2a−1)-node, which is another reason for requiring a≤(b+1)/2.\\nTable 15.1 shows the performance of a map realized with an (a,b)tree.\\nOperation\\n Running Time\\nM[k]\\n O(\\nf(b)\\nlogalogn)\\nM[k] = v\\n O(\\ng(b)\\nlogalogn)\\ndelM[k]\\n O(\\ng(b)\\nlogalogn)\\nTable 15.1: Time bounds for an n-entry map realized by an (a,b)tree T.

A\\nB-tree of order dis an (a,b)tree with a=⌈d/2⌉and b=d.

This choice allows us to assume that a\\nand bare also proportional to Bin the analysis of the search and update operations\\non(a,b)trees. Thus, f(b)and g(b)are both O(1), for each time we access a node\\nto perform a search or an update operation, we need only perform a single disktransfer.\\nAs we have already observed above, each search or update requires that we\\nexamine at most O(1)nodes for each level of the tree. Therefore, any map search\\nor update operation on a B-tree requires only O(log\\n⌈d/2⌉n),t h a ti s , O(logn/logB),\\ndisk transfers. For example, an insert operation proceeds down the B-tree to locatethe node in which to insert the new entry. If the node would overﬂow (to have d+1\\nchildren) because of this addition, then this node is split into two nodes that have\\n⌊(d+1)/2⌋and⌈(d+1)/2⌉children, respectively. This process is then repeated\\nat the next level up, and will continue for at most O(log\\nBn)levels.\\nLikewise, if a remove operation results in a node underﬂow (to have ⌈d/2⌉−1\\nchildren), then we move references from a sibling node with at least ⌈d/2⌉+1\\nchildren or we perform a fusion operation of this node with its sibling (and repeat\\nthis computation at the parent). As with the insert operation, this will continue up\\nthe B-tree for at most O(logBn)levels.

External-Memory Sorting 715\\n15.4 External-Memory Sorting\\nIn addition to data structures, such as maps, that need to be implemented in external\\nmemory, there are many algorithms that must also operate on input sets that are toolarge to ﬁt entirely into internal memory. In this case, the objective is to solve the\\nalgorithmic problem using as few block transfers as possible. The most classic\\ndomain for such external-memory algorithms is the sorting problem.\\nMultiway Merge-Sort\\nAn efﬁcient way to sort a set Sofnobjects in external memory amounts to a sim-\\nple external-memory variation on the familiar merge-sort algorithm. The main idea\\nbehind this variation is to merge many recursively sorted lists at a time, thereby\\nreducing the number of levels of recursion. Speciﬁcally, a high-level descriptionof this multiway merge-sort method is to divide Sinto dsubsets S\\n1,S2,...,Sdof\\nroughly equal size, recursively sort each subset Si, and then simultaneously merge\\nalldsorted lists into a sorted representation of S. If we can perform the merge pro-\\ncess using only O(n/B)disk transfers, then, for large enough values of n, the total\\nnumber of transfers performed by this algorithm satisﬁes the following recurrence:\\nt(n)= d·t(n/d)+ cn/B,\\nfor some constant c≥1. We can stop the recursion when n≤B, since we can\\nperform a single block transfer at this point, getting all of the objects into internalmemory, and then sort the set with an efﬁcient internal-memory algorithm. Thus,\\nthe stopping criterion for t(n)is\\nt(n)=1i f n/B≤1.\\nThis implies a closed-form solution that t(n)isO((n/B)log\\nd(n/B)),w h i c hi s\\nO((n/B)log (n/B)/logd).\\nThus, if we can choose dto be Θ(M/B),w h e r e Mis the size of the internal memory,\\nthen the worst-case number of block transfers performed by this multiway merge-\\nsort algorithm will be quite low. For reasons given in the next section, we choose\\nd=(M/B)−1.\\nThe only aspect of this algorithm left to specify, then, is how to perform the d-way\\nmerge using only O(n/B)block transfers.'),\n",

Memory Management and B-Trees\\n15.4.1 Multiway Merging\\nIn a standard merge-sort (Section 12.2), the merge process combines two sorted\\nsequences into one by repeatedly taking the smaller of the items at the front of thetwo respective lists. In a d-way merge, we repeatedly ﬁnd the smallest among the\\nitems at the front of the dsequences and place it as the next element of the merged\\nsequence. We continue until all elements are included.\\nIn the context of an external-memory sorting algorithm, if main memory has\\nsize Mand each block has size B, we can store up to M/Bblocks within main\\nmemory at any given time. We speciﬁcally choose d=(M/B)−1s ot h a tw ec a n\\nafford to keep one block from each input sequence in main memory at any given\\ntime, and to have one additional block to use as a buffer for the merged sequence.(See Figure 15.5.)\\nQ 11\\n13 16 19 3344 53 5660\\n66 75\\n72 78 8825 27 40 4341 49 50 57\\n37 46 52 58\\n35 48 51 5945 54 65 42 30 3912 24 26 34\\n17 18 2978 1 0\\nFigure 15.5: Ad-way merge with d=5a n d B=4. Blocks that currently reside in\\nmain memory are shaded.\\nWe maintain the smallest unprocessed element from each input sequence in\\nmain memory, requesting the next block from a sequence when the preceding block\\nhas been exhausted. Similarly, we use one block of internal memory to buffer themerged sequence, ﬂushing that block to external memory when full. In this way,the total number of transfers performed during a single d-way merge is O(n/B),\\nsince we scan each block of list S\\nionce, and we write out each block of the merged\\nlist S′once. In terms of computation time, choosing the smallest of dvalues can\\ntrivially be performed using O(d)operations. If we are willing to devote O(d)\\ninternal memory, we can maintain a priority queue identifying the smallest element\\nfrom each sequence, thereby performing each step of the merge in O(logd)time\\nby removing the minimum element and replacing it with the next element from the\\nsame sequence. Hence, the internal time for the d-way merge is O(nlogd).\\nProposition 15.3: Given an array-based sequence Sofnelements stored com-\\npactly in external memory, we can sort Swith O((n/B)log (n/B)/log (M/B))block\\ntransfers and O(nlogn)internal computations, where Mis the size of the internal\\nmemory and Bis the size of a block.'),\n",

In Python, the\\nbuilt-in strclass represents strings based upon the Unicode international character\\nset, a 16-bit character encoding that covers most written languages. Unicode is\\nan extension of the 7-bit ASCII character set that includes the basic Latin alpha-bet, numerals, and common symbols. Strings are particularly important in most\\nprogramming applications, as text is often used for input and output.\\nA basic introduction to the strclass was provided in Section 1.2.3, including use\\nof string literals, such as\\nhello\\n , and the syntax str(obj) that is used to construct\\na string representation of a typical object. Common operators that are supported\\nby strings, such as the use of +for concatenation, were further discussed in Sec-\\ntion 1.3. This appendix serves as a more detailed reference, describing convenientbehaviors that strings support for the processing of text. To organize our overviewof the strclass behaviors, we group them into the following broad categories of\\nfunctionality.\\nSearching for Substrings\\nThe operator syntax, pattern ins, can be used to determine if the given pattern\\noccurs as a substring of string s. Table A.1 describes several related methods that\\ndetermine the number of such occurrences, and the index at which the leftmost orrightmost such occurrence begins. Each of the functions in this table accepts two\\noptional parameters, start andend, which are indices that effectively restrict the\\nsearch to the implicit slice s[start:end] . For example, the call s.ﬁnd(pattern, 5)\\nrestricts the search to s[5: ].\\nCalling Syntax\\n Description\\ns.count(pattern)\\n Return the number of non-overlapping occurrences of pattern\\ns.ﬁnd(pattern)\\n Return the index starting the leftmost occurrence of pattern; else -1\\ns.index(pattern)\\n Similar to ﬁnd, but raise ValueError if not found\\ns.rﬁnd(pattern)\\n Return the index starting the rightmost occurrence of pattern; else -1\\ns.rindex(pattern)\\n Similar to rﬁnd , but raise ValueError if not found\\nTable A.1: Methods that search for substrings.'),\n",

Character Strings in Python\\nConstructing Related Strings\\nStrings in Python are immutable, so none of their methods modify an existing string\\ninstance. However, many methods return a newly constructed string that is closelyrelated to an existing one. Table A.2 provides a summary of such methods, includ-ing those that replace a given pattern with another, that vary the case of alphabetic\\ncharacters, that produce a ﬁxed-width string with desired justiﬁcation, and that pro-\\nduce a copy of a string with extraneous characters stripped from either end.\\nCalling Syntax\\n Description\\ns.replace(old, new)\\n Return a copy of swith all occurrences of oldreplaced by new\\ns.capitalize()\\n Return a copy of swith its ﬁrst character having uppercase\\ns.upper()\\n Return a copy of swith all alphabetic characters in uppercase\\ns.lower()\\n Return a copy of swith all alphabetic characters in lowercase\\ns.center(width)\\n Return a copy of s, padded to width, centered among spaces\\ns.ljust(width)\\n Return a copy of s, padded to width with trailing spaces\\ns.rjust(width)\\n Return a copy of s, padded to width with leading spaces\\ns.zﬁll(width)\\n Return a copy of s, padded to width with leading zeros\\ns.strip()\\n Return a copy of s, with leading and trailing whitespace removed\\ns.lstrip()\\n Return a copy of s, with leading whitespace removed\\ns.rstrip()\\n Return a copy of s, with trailing whitespace removed\\nTable A.2: String methods that produce related strings.\\nSeveral of these methods accept optional parameters not detailed in the table.\\nFor example, the replace method replaces all nonoverlapping occurrences of the old\\npattern by default, but an optional parameter can limit the number of replacementsthat are performed. The methods that center or justify a text use spaces as the\\ndefault ﬁll character when padding, but an alternate ﬁll character can be speciﬁed\\nas an optional parameter. Similarly, all variants of the strip methods remove leadingand trailing whitespace by default, but an optional string parameter designates thechoice of characters that should be removed from the ends.\\nTesting Boolean Conditions\\nTable A.3 includes methods that test for a Boolean property of a string, such as\\nwhether it begins or ends with a pattern, or whether its characters qualify as be-\\ning alphabetic, numeric, whitespace, etc. For the standard ASCII character set,alphabetic characters are the uppercase A–Z, and lowercase a–z, numeric digits are0–9, and whitespace includes the space character, tab character, newline, and car-riage return.

Character Strings in Python\\nThe other methods discussed in Table A.4 serve a dual purpose to join,a st h e y\\nbegin with a string and produce a sequence of substrings based upon a given de-\\nlimiter. For example, the call\\n red and green and blue\\n .split(\\n and\\n )pro-\\nduces the result [\\nred\\n,\\ngreen\\n ,\\nblue\\n ].

The method is invoked with a syntax s.format(arg0, arg1, ...) ,\\nwhere sserves as a formatting string that expresses the desired result with one\\nor more placeholders in which the arguments will be substituted. As a simple\\nexample, the expression\\n {} had a little {}\\n .format(\\n Mary\\n ,\\nlamb\\n )pro-\\nduces the result\\n Mary had a little lamb\\n . The pairs of curly braces in the\\nformatting string are the placeholders for ﬁelds that will be substituted into the\\nresult. By default, the arguments sent to the function are substituted using posi-tional order; hence,\\nMary\\n was the ﬁrst substitute and\\n lamb\\n the second. How-\\never, the substitution patterns may be explicitly numbered to alter the order, orto use a single argument in more than one location. For example, the expres-sion\\n{0}, {0}, {0} your {1}\\n .format(\\n row\\n,\\nboat\\n )produces the result\\nrow, row, row your boat\\n .\\nAll substitution patterns allow use of annotations to pad an argument to a par-\\nticular width, using a choice of ﬁll character and justiﬁcation mode. An example ofsuch an annotation is\\n{:-^20}\\n .format(\\n hello\\n ). In this example, the hyphen\\n(-) serves as a ﬁll character, the caret ( ^) designates a desire for the string to be\\ncentered, and 20 is the desired width for the argument. This example results in\\nthe string\\n -------hello--------\\n . By default, space is used as a ﬁll character\\na n da ni m p l i e d <character dictates left-justiﬁcation; an explicit >character would\\ndictate right-justiﬁcation.\\nThere are additional formatting options for numeric types. A number will be\\npadded with zeros rather than spaces if its width description is prefaced with azero. For example, a date can be formatted in traditional “YYYY/MM/DD” form\\nas\\n{}/{:02}/{:02}\\n .format(year, month, day) . Integers can be converted to\\nbinary, octal, or hexadecimal by respectively adding the character b,o,o rxas a\\nsufﬁx to the annotation. The displayed precision of a ﬂoating-point number is spec-\\niﬁed with a decimal point and the subsequent number of desired digits. For exam-\\nple, the expression\\n {:.3}.format(2/3)\\n produces the string\\n 0.667\\n , rounded\\nto three digits after the decimal point. A programmer can explicitly designate useof ﬁxed-point representation (e.g.,\\n0.667\\n ) by adding the character fa sas u f ﬁ x ,\\nor scientiﬁc notation (e.g.,\\n 6.667e-01\\n ) by adding the character eas a sufﬁx.'),\n",

Formally, a random variable is a function Xthat maps outcomes\\nfrom some sample space Sto real numbers. An indicator random variable is a\\nrandom variable that maps outcomes to the set {0,1}. Often in data structure and\\nalgorithm analysis we use a random variable Xto characterize the running time of\\na randomized algorithm. In this case, the sample space Sis deﬁned by all possible\\noutcomes of the random sources used in the algorithm.\\nWe are most interested in the typical, average, or “expected” value of such a\\nrandom variable. The expected value of a random variable Xis deﬁned as\\nE(X)=\\n∑\\nxxPr(X=x),\\nwhere the summation is deﬁned over the range of X(which in this case is assumed\\nto be discrete).'),\n",
